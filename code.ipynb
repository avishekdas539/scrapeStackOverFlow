Used under the CC-By-SA 3.0 license.ImageCC-By-SA 3.0Now for the sake of argument, suppose this is back in the 1800s - before long-distance or radio communication.You are a blind operator of a junction and you hear a train coming. You have no idea which way it is supposed to go. You stop the train to ask the driver which direction they want. And then you set the switch appropriately.Trains are heavy and have a lot of inertia, so they take forever to start up and slow down.Is there a better way? You guess which direction the train will go!If you guess right every time, the train will never have to stop.\\nIf you guess wrong too often, the train will spend a lot of time stopping, backing up, and restarting.Consider an if-statement: At the processor level, it is a branch instruction:You are a processor and you see a branch. You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path.Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines. This means they take forever to \"warm up\" and \"slow down\".Is there a better way? You guess which direction the branch will go!If you guess right every time, the execution will never have to stop.\\nIf you guess wrong too often, you spend a lot of time stalling, rolling back, and restarting.This is branch prediction. I admit it\\'s not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn\\'t know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.How would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path? You look at the past history! If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same...In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it. This is more or less how branch predictors work.Most applications have well-behaved branches. Therefore, modern branch predictors will typically achieve >90% hit rates. But when faced with unpredictable branches with no recognizable patterns, branch predictors are virtually useless.Further reading: \"Branch predictor\" article on Wikipedia.\"Branch predictor\" article on Wikipediaif (data[c] >= 128)\\n    sum += data[c];\\nNotice that the data is evenly distributed between 0 and 255. When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement.This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction.Quick visualization:T = branch taken\\nN = branch not taken\\n\\ndata[] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ... 250, 251, 252, ...\\nbranch = N  N  N  N  N  ...

TTTTTTTTTT  (easy to predict)\\nHowever, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can\\'t predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing).data[] = 226, 185, 125, 158, 198, 144, 217, 79, 202, 118,  14, 150, 177, 182, ...\\nbranch =   T,   T,   N,   T,   T,   T,   T,  N,   T,   N,   N,   T,   T,   T  ...\\n\\n       = TTNTTTTNTNNTTT ...   (completely random - impossible to predict)\\nWhat can be done?If the compiler isn\\'t able to optimize the branch into a conditional move, you can try some hacks if you are willing to sacrifice readability for performance.Replace:if (data[c] >= 128)\\n    sum += data[c];\\nwith:int t = (data[c] - 128) >> 31;\\nsum += ~t & data[c];\\nThis eliminates the branch and replaces it with some bitwise operations.(Note that this hack is not strictly equivalent to the original if-statement. But in this case, it\\'s valid for all the input values of data[].)data[]Benchmarks: Core i7 920 @ 3.5 GHzC++ - Visual Studio 2010 - x64 ReleaseJava - NetBeans 7.1.1 JDK 7 - x64Observations:A general rule of thumb is to avoid data-dependent branching in critical loops (such as in this example).Update:GCC 4.6.1 with -O3 or -ftree-vectorize on x64 is able to generate a conditional move, so there is no difference between the sorted and unsorted data - both are fast.-O3-ftree-vectorize(Or somewhat fast: for the already-sorted case, cmov can be slower especially if GCC puts it on the critical path instead of just add, especially on Intel before Broadwell where cmov has 2 cycle latency: gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2)cmovaddcmovgcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2VC++ 2010 is unable to generate conditional moves for this branch even under /Ox./OxIntel C++ Compiler (ICC) 11 does something miraculous. It interchanges the two loops, thereby hoisting the unpredictable branch to the outer loop.

In other words, ICC took advantage of the test-loop to defeat the benchmark...Intel C++ Compilerinterchanges the two loopsIf you give the Intel compiler the branchless code, it just outright vectorizes it... and is just as fast as with the branch (with the loop interchange).This goes to show that even mature modern compilers can vary wildly in their ability to optimize code...',\n",

              "   \"The reason why performance improves drastically when the data is sorted is that the branch prediction penalty is removed, as explained beautifully in Mysticial's answer.Mysticial's answerNow, if we look at the codeif (data[c] >= 128)\\n    sum += data[c];\\nwe can find that the meaning of this particular if... else... branch is to add something when a condition is satisfied. This type of branch can be easily transformed into a conditional move statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: cmovl, in an x86 system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed.if... else...cmovlx86In C, thus C++, the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in x86, is the ternary operator ... ? ... : ....

We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern.Now let's look more closely by investigating the x86 assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions max1 and max2.x86max1max2max1 uses the conditional branch if... else ...:max1if... else ...int max1(int a, int b) {\\n    if (a > b)\\n        return a;\\n    else\\n        return b;\\n}\\nmax2 uses the ternary operator ... ? ... : ...:max2... ? ... : ...int max2(int a, int b) {\\n    return a > b ? a : b;\\n}\\nOn an x86-64 machine, GCC -S generates the assembly below.GCC -S:max1\\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\\n    cmpl    -8(%rbp), %eax\\n    jle     .L2\\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\\n    jmp     .L4\\n.L2:\\n    movl    -8(%rbp), %eax\\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\\n.L4:\\n    movl    -12(%rbp), %eax\\n    leave\\n    ret\\n\\n:max2\\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\\n    cmpl    %eax, -8(%rbp)\\n    cmovge  -8(%rbp), %eax\\n    leave\\n    ret\\nmax2 uses much less code due to the usage of instruction cmovge. But the real gain is that max2 does not involve branch jumps, jmp, which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right.max2cmovgemax2jmpSo why does a conditional move perform better?In a typical x86 processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called pipelining.x86pipeliningIn a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict.In a conditional move case, the execution of conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like Fetch and Decode do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only the latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy.FetchDecodeThe book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for Conditional Move Instructions, entire Chapter 4 for Processor Architecture, and Section 5.11.2 for special treatment for Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties.Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second editionSometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, and sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between a branch and a conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.\",\n",

              "   'I just read up on this question and its answers, and I feel an answer is missing.A common way to eliminate branch prediction that I\\'ve found to work particularly good in managed languages is a table lookup instead of using a branch (although I haven\\'t tested it in this case).This approach works in general if:Background and whyFrom a processor perspective, your memory is slow. To compensate for the difference in speed, a couple of caches are built into your processor (L1/L2 cache). So imagine that you\\'re doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get its \\'load\\' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache -- and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this \\'load\\' will slow down your program.Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we\\'ve already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever (in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible!).Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well.The first thing we need to know is what is small? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are <= 4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it\\'s probably worth reconsidering.Constructing a tableSo we\\'ve figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps multiply). You want to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of \\'unique key\\' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do.In this case: >= 128 means we can keep the value, < 128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an \\'AND\\': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF\\'s.Managed languagesYou might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don\\'t mess up...Well, not exactly... :-)There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example:for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; ++i)\\n{\\n   // Use array[i]\\n}\\nIn this case, it\\'s obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never be hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check altogether. WOW, that means no branch. Similarly, it will deal with other obvious cases.If you run into trouble with lookups in managed languages -- the key is to add a & 0x[something]FFF to your lookup function to make the boundary check predictable -- and watch it going faster.& 0x[something]FFFThe result of this case// Generate data\\nint arraySize = 32768;\\nint[] data = new int[arraySize];\\n\\nRandom random = new Random(0);\\nfor (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\\n{\\n    data[c] = random.Next(256);\\n}\\n\\n/*To keep the spirit of the code intact, I\\'ll make a separate lookup table\\n(I assume we cannot modify \\'data\\' or the number of loops)*/\\n\\nint[] lookup = new int[256];\\n\\nfor (int c = 0; c < 256; ++c)\\n{\\n    lookup[c] = (c >= 128) ? c : 0;\\n}\\n\\n// Test\\nDateTime startTime = System.DateTime.Now;\\nlong sum = 0;\\n\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\\n{\\n    // Primary loop\\n    for (int j = 0; j < arraySize; ++j)\\n    {\\n        /* Here you basically want to use simple operations - so no\\n        random branches, but things like &, |, *, -, +, etc. are fine. */\\n        sum += lookup[data[j]];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nDateTime endTime = System.DateTime.Now;\\nConsole.WriteLine(endTime - startTime);\\nConsole.WriteLine(\"sum = \" + sum);\\nConsole.ReadLine();\\n',\n",

Here comes the \"branch predictor\". A branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance!if-then-elseLet\\'s do some bench marking to understand it betterThe performance of an if-statement depends on whether its condition has a predictable pattern. If the condition is always true or always false, the branch prediction logic in the processor will pick up the pattern. On the other hand, if the pattern is unpredictable, the if-statement will be much more expensive.ififLet’s measure the performance of this loop with different conditions:for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)\\n    if (condition)\\n        sum++;\\nHere are the timings of the loop with different true-false patterns:Condition                Pattern             Time (ms)\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n(i & 0×80000000) == 0    T repeated          322\\n\\n(i & 0xffffffff) == 0    F repeated          276\\n\\n(i & 1) == 0             TF alternating      760\\n\\n(i & 3) == 0             TFFFTFFF…           513\\n\\n(i & 2) == 0             TTFFTTFF…           1675\\n\\n(i & 4) == 0             TTTTFFFFTTTTFFFF…   1275\\n\\n(i & 8) == 0             8T 8F 8T 8F …       752\\n\\n(i & 16) == 0            16T 16F 16T 16F …   490\\nA “bad” true-false pattern can make an if-statement up to six times slower than a “good” pattern! Of course, which pattern is good and which is bad depends on the exact instructions generated by the compiler and on the specific processor.ifSo there is no doubt about the impact of branch prediction on performance!',\n",
              "   'One way to avoid branch prediction errors is to build a lookup table, and index it using the data.  Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer.But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values >= 128.  That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit.  Let\\'s call this bit the \"decision bit\".By using the 0/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted.  Our code will always add a value, but when the decision bit is 0, we will add the value somewhere we don\\'t care about.  Here\\'s the code:// Test\\nclock_t start = clock();\\nlong long a[] = {0, 0};\\nlong long sum;\\n\\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\\n{\\n    // Primary loop\\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\\n    {\\n        int j = (data[c] >> 7);\\n        a[j] += data[c];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\ndouble elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;\\nsum = a[1];\\nThis code wastes half of the adds but never has a branch prediction failure.  It\\'s tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement.But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting.  This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called lut for \"LookUp Table\" in the code).  Here\\'s the C++ code:lut// Declare and then fill in the lookup table\\nint lut[256];\\nfor (unsigned c = 0; c < 256; ++c)\\n    lut[c] = (c >= 128) ? c : 0;\\n\\n// Use the lookup table after it is built\\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)\\n{\\n    // Primary loop\\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\\n    {\\n        sum += lut[data[c]];\\n    }\\n}\\nIn this case, the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fits nicely in a cache and all was fast.  This technique wouldn\\'t work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical.  On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table.  For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index.  A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical.The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an if statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use.  I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers (pLeft and pRight or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers and used the \"decision bit\" technique to decide which one to follow.  For example, instead of:ifpLeftpRightif (x < node->value)\\n    node = node->pLeft;\\nelse\\n    node = node->pRight;\\nthis library would do something like:i = (x < node->value);\\nnode = node->link[i];\\nHere\\'s a link to this code: Red Black Trees, Eternally ConfuzzledRed Black Trees',\n",

              "   \"The above behavior is happening because of Branch prediction.To understand branch prediction one must first understand an Instruction Pipeline.The the steps of running an instruction can be overlapped with the sequence of steps of running the previous and next instruction, so that different steps can be executed concurrently in parallel. This technique is known as instruction pipelining and is used to increase throughput in modern processors. To understand this better please see this example on Wikipedia.example on WikipediaGenerally, modern processors have quite long (and wide) pipelines, so many instruction can be in flight.  See Modern Microprocessors\\nA 90-Minute Guide! which starts by introducing basic in-order pipelining and goes from there.Modern Microprocessors\\nA 90-Minute Guide!But for ease let's consider a simple in-order pipeline with these 4 steps only.\\n(Like a classic 5-stage RISC, but omitting a separate MEM stage.)classic 5-stage RISC4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions.\\nMoving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions:                        A) if (data[c] >= 128)\\n                                /\\\\\\n                               /  \\\\\\n                              /    \\\\\\n                        true /      \\\\ false\\n                            /        \\\\\\n                           /          \\\\\\n                          /            \\\\\\n                         /              \\\\\\n              B) sum += data[c];          C) for loop or print().\\nWithout branch prediction, the following would occur:To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait (stall) till the instruction A leaves the EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A.  (i.e. where to fetch from next.) So the pipeline will look like this:Without prediction: when if condition is true:\\nifWithout prediction: When if condition is false:\\nifAs a result of waiting for the result of instruction A, the total CPU cycles spent in the above case (without branch prediction; for both true and false) is 7.So what is branch prediction?Branch predictor will try to guess which way a branch (an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example).In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this:\\nIf it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay.\\nThe time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good branch predictor.branch predictorIn the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. (Or fall back to static prediction, typically forward not-taken, backward taken).  Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history.\\nFor an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities:Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run.So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct.\\nIn the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly.\\nIn the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history.In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles.But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array.Further reading:Modern Microprocessors\\nA 90-Minute Guide!Dan Luu's article on branch predictionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictorBranch Prediction and the Performance of Interpreters -\\nDon’t Trust FolkloreStatic branch prediction on newer Intel processorsifbreakreal effectlikelyunlikely\",\n",

Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value 0 for false and 1 for true.0false1trueBoolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than 0 or 1, but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than 0 or 1. This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary.\\nConsider example:0101bool a, b, c, d;\\nc = a && b;\\nd = a || b;\\nThis is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way:bool a, b, c, d;\\nif (a != 0) {\\n    if (b != 0) {\\n        c = 1;\\n    }\\n    else {\\n        goto CFALSE;\\n    }\\n}\\nelse {\\n    CFALSE:\\n    c = 0;\\n}\\nif (a == 0) {\\n    if (b == 0) {\\n        d = 0;\\n    }\\n    else {\\n        goto DTRUE;\\n    }\\n}\\nelse {\\n    DTRUE:\\n    d = 1;\\n}\\nThis code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than 0 and 1. The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if a and b has been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this:01abchar a = 0, b = 1, c, d;\\nc = a & b;\\nd = a | b;\\nchar is used instead of bool in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators (& and |) instead of the Boolean operators (&& and ||). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (|) works even if a and b have other values than 0 or 1. The AND operator (&) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator (^) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than 0 and 1.charbool&|&&|||ab01&^01~ can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be 0 or 1 by XOR'ing it with 1:~011bool a, b;\\nb = !a;\\ncan be optimized to:char a = 0, b;\\nb = a ^ 1;\\na && b cannot be replaced with a & b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is false ( && will not evaluate b, & will). Likewise, a || b can not be replaced with a | b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is true.a && ba & bbafalse&&b&a || ba | bbatrueUsing bitwise operators is more advantageous if the operands are variables than if the operands are comparisons:bool a; double x, y, z;\\na = x > y && z < 5.0;\\nis optimal in most cases (unless you expect the && expression to generate many branch mispredictions).&&\",\n",

Branch PredictorI\\'m not trying to add something but explaining the concept in another way. \\nThere is a concise introduction on the wiki which contains text and diagram.\\nI do like the explanation below which uses a diagram to elaborate the Branch Predictor intuitively.In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a\\n  digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an\\n  if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The\\n  purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the\\n  instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in\\n  achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined\\n  microprocessor architectures such as x86.Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump\\n  instruction. A conditional jump can either be \"not taken\" and continue\\n  execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately\\n  after the conditional jump, or it can be \"taken\" and jump to a\\n  different place in program memory where the second branch of code is\\n  stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be\\n  taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the\\n  conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction\\n  pipeline (see fig. 1).Based on the described scenario, I have written an animation demo to show how instructions are executed in a pipeline in different situations.Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the\\n  conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the\\n  next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline.The example contains three instructions and the first one is a conditional jump instruction. The latter two instructions can go into the pipeline until the conditional jump instruction is executed. It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.It will take 7 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to\\n  the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the\\n  execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long\\n  pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock\\n  cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a\\n  more advanced branch predictor.As you can see, it seems we don\\'t have a reason not to use Branch Predictor.It\\'s quite a simple demo that clarifies the very basic part of Branch Predictor.

              "   'On ARM, there is no branch needed, because every instruction has a 4-bit condition field, which tests (at zero cost) any of 16 different different conditions that may arise in the Processor Status Register, and if the condition on an instruction is false, the instruction is skipped. This eliminates the need for short branches, and there would be no branch prediction hit for this algorithm. Therefore, the sorted version of this algorithm would run slower than the unsorted version on ARM, because of the extra overhead of sorting.16 different different conditionsThe inner loop for this algorithm would look something like the following in ARM assembly language:MOV R0, #0   // R0 = sum = 0\\nMOV R1, #0   // R1 = c = 0\\nADR R2, data // R2 = addr of data array (put this instruction outside outer loop)\\n.inner_loop  // Inner loop branch label\\n    LDRB R3, [R2, R1]   // R3 = data[c]\\n    CMP R3, #128        // compare R3 to 128\\n    ADDGE R0, R0, R3    // if R3 >= 128, then sum += data[c] -- no branch needed!\\n    ADD R1, R1, #1      // c++\\n    CMP R1, #arraySize  // compare c to arraySize\\n    BLT inner_loop      // Branch to inner_loop if c < arraySize\\nBut this is actually part of a bigger picture:CMP opcodes always update the status bits in the Processor Status Register (PSR), because that is their purpose, but most other instructions do not touch the PSR unless you add an optional S suffix to the instruction, specifying that the PSR should be updated based on the result of the instruction. Just like the 4-bit condition suffix, being able to execute instructions without affecting the PSR is a mechanism that reduces the need for branches on ARM, and also facilitates out of order dispatch at the hardware level, because after performing some operation X that updates the status bits, subsequently (or in parallel) you can do a bunch of other work that explicitly should not affect (or be affected by) the status bits, then you can test the state of the status bits set earlier by X.CMPSThe condition testing field and the optional \"set status bit\" field can be combined, for example:ADD R1, R2, R3R1 = R2 + R3ADDGE R1, R2, R3ADDS R1, R2, R3NZCVADDSGE R1, R2, R3GEMost processor architectures do not have this ability to specify whether or not the status bits should be updated for a given operation, which can necessitate writing additional code to save and later restore status bits, or may require additional branches, or may limit the processor\\'s out of order execution efficiency: one of the side effects of most CPU instruction set architectures forcibly updating status bits after most instructions is that it is much harder to tease apart which instructions can be run in parallel without interfering with each other. Updating status bits has side effects, therefore has a linearizing effect on code. ARM\\'s ability to mix and match branch-free condition testing on any instruction with the option to either update or not update the status bits after any instruction is extremely powerful, for both assembly language programmers and compilers, and produces very efficient code.When you don\\'t have to branch, you can avoid the time cost of flushing the pipeline for what would otherwise be short branches, and you can avoid the design complexity of many forms of speculative evalution. The performance impact of the initial naive imlementations of the mitigations for many recently discovered processor vulnerabilities (Spectre etc.) shows you just how much the performance of modern processors depends upon complex speculative evaluation logic. With a short pipeline and the dramatically reduced need for branching, ARM just doesn\\'t need to rely on speculative evaluation as much as CISC processors. (Of course high-end ARM implementations do include speculative evaluation, but it\\'s a smaller part of the performance story.)If you have ever wondered why ARM has been so phenomenally successful, the brilliant effectiveness and interplay of these two mechanisms (combined with another mechanism that lets you \"barrel shift\" left or right one of the two arguments of any arithmetic operator or offset memory access operator at zero additional cost) are a big part of the story, because they are some of the greatest sources of the ARM architecture\\'s efficiency. The brilliance of the original designers of the ARM ISA back in 1983, Steve Furber and Roger (now Sophie) Wilson, cannot be overstated.',\n",
              "   'It\\'s about branch prediction. What is it?A branch predictor is one of the ancient performance-improving techniques which still finds relevance in modern architectures. While the simple prediction techniques provide fast lookup and power efficiency they suffer from a high misprediction rate.On the other hand, complex branch predictions –either neural-based or variants of two-level branch prediction –provide better prediction accuracy, but they consume more power and complexity increases exponentially.In addition to this, in complex prediction techniques, the time taken to predict the branches is itself very high –ranging from 2 to 5 cycles –which is comparable to the execution time of actual branches.Branch prediction is essentially an optimization (minimization) problem where the emphasis is on to achieve lowest possible miss rate, low power consumption, and low complexity with minimum resources.There really are three different kinds of branches:Forward conditional branches - based on a run-time condition, the PC (program counter) is changed to point to an address forward in the instruction stream.Backward conditional branches - the PC is changed to point backward in the instruction stream. The branch is based on some condition, such as branching backwards to the beginning of a program loop when a test at the end of the loop states the loop should be executed again.Unconditional branches - this includes jumps, procedure calls, and returns that have no specific condition. For example, an unconditional jump instruction might be coded in assembly language as simply \"jmp\", and the instruction stream must immediately be directed to the target location pointed to by the jump instruction, whereas a conditional jump that might be coded as \"jmpne\" would redirect the instruction stream only if the result of a comparison of two values in a previous \"compare\" instructions shows the values to not be equal. (The segmented addressing scheme used by the x86 architecture adds extra complexity since jumps can be either \"near\" (within a segment) or \"far\" (outside the segment). Each type has different effects on branch prediction algorithms.)Static/dynamic Branch Prediction: Static branch prediction is used by the microprocessor the first time a conditional branch is encountered, and dynamic branch prediction is used for succeeding executions of the conditional branch code.References:Branch predictorBranch predictorA Demonstration of Self-ProfilingA Demonstration of Self-ProfilingBranch Prediction ReviewBranch Prediction ReviewBranch Prediction (Using wayback machine)Branch Prediction',\n",

In fact, someone did do a more systematic study (a quick web search will find it) and most implementations show that effect.One reason is branch prediction: the key operation in the sort algorithm is “if(v[i] < pivot]) …” or equivalent. For a sorted sequence that test is always true whereas, for a random sequence, the branch chosen varies randomly.“if(v[i] < pivot]) …”Another reason is that when the vector is already sorted, we never need to move elements to their correct position. The effect of these little details is the factor of five or six that we saw.Quicksort (and sorting in general) is a complex study that has attracted some of the greatest minds of computer science.

No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].”git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch][localbranch][remotebranch]I issued git push origin: bugfix and it worked beautifully.

There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the \"server\" don\\'t need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.git fetch is the command that says \"bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date.\" git fetchgit pull says \"bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code.\"git pullNormally git pull does this by doing a git fetch to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.git pullgit fetchThe take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least three copies of a project on your workstation.

Where does Git fetch store the new commits?git fetchGreat question. First and foremost, the heads or remotes don\\'t store the new commits. They just have pointers to commits. So with git fetch you download the latest git objects (blob, tree, commits. To fully understand the objects watch this video on git internals), but only update your remotes pointer to point to the latest commit of that branch.  It\\'s still isolated from your working copy, because your branch\\'s pointer in the heads directory hasn\\'t updated. It will only update upon a merge/pull. But again where? Let\\'s find out.headsremotespointersgit fetchgit objectsthis video on git internalsremotesheadsmergepullIn your project directory (i.e., where you do your git commands) do:gitls.

In many cases, the yield approach will be a lot more memory efficient and faster too. In other cases, this trick will get you stuck in an infinite loop, even though the original function works just fine. Read on to learn more...yieldFirst, the iterator protocol - when you writefor x in mylist:\\n    ...loop body...\\nPython performs the following two steps:Gets an iterator for mylist:mylistCall iter(mylist) -> this returns an object with a next() method (or __next__() in Python 3).iter(mylist)next()__next__()[This is the step most people forget to tell you about]Uses the iterator to loop over items:Keep calling the next() method on the iterator returned from step 1. The return value from next() is assigned to x and the loop body is executed. If an exception StopIteration is raised from within next(), it means there are no more values in the iterator and the loop is exited.next()next()xStopIterationnext()The truth is Python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loop over the contents of an object - so it could be a for loop, but it could also be code like otherlist.extend(mylist) (where otherlist is a Python list).otherlist.extend(mylist)otherlistHere mylist is an iterable because it implements the iterator protocol. In a user-defined class, you can implement the __iter__() method to make instances of your class iterable. This method should return an iterator. An iterator is an object with a next() method. It is possible to implement both __iter__() and next() on the same class, and have __iter__() return self. This will work for simple cases, but not when you want two iterators looping over the same object at the same time.mylist__iter__()next()__iter__()next()__iter__()selfSo that's the iterator protocol, many objects implement this protocol:__iter__()Note that a for loop doesn't know what kind of object it's dealing with - it just follows the iterator protocol, and is happy to get item after item as it calls next(). Built-in lists return their items one by one, dictionaries return the keys one by one, files return the lines one by one, etc. And generators return... well that's where yield comes in:fornext()yielddef f123():\\n    yield 1\\n    yield 2\\n    yield 3\\n\\nfor item in f123():\\n    print item\\nInstead of yield statements, if you had three return statements in f123() only the first would get executed, and the function would exit. But f123() is no ordinary function. When f123() is called, it does not return any of the values in the yield statements! It returns a generator object. Also, the function does not really exit - it goes into a suspended state. When the for loop tries to loop over the generator object, the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from, executes the next line of code, in this case, a yield statement, and returns that as the next item. This happens until the function exits, at which point the generator raises StopIteration, and the loop exits.yieldreturnf123()f123()f123()foryieldyieldStopIterationSo the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol, by exposing __iter__() and next() methods to keep the for loop happy. At the other end, however, it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it, and puts it back in suspended mode.__iter__()next()forUsually, you can write code that doesn't use generators but implements the same logic. One option is to use the temporary list 'trick' I mentioned before. That will not work in all cases, for e.g. if you have infinite loops, or it may make inefficient use of memory when you have a really long list. The other approach is to implement a new iterable class SomethingIter that keeps the state in instance members and performs the next logical step in its next() (or __next__() in Python 3) method. Depending on the logic, the code inside the next() method may end up looking very complex and prone to bugs. Here generators provide a clean and easy solution.next()__next__()next()\",\n",

Furthermore, advanced usage lets you use generators as coroutines (see below).yieldgenerator = myYieldingFunction(...)  # basically a list (but lazy)\\nx = list(generator)  # evaluate every element into a list\\n\\n   generator\\n       v\\n[x[0], ..., ???]\\n\\n         generator\\n             v\\n[x[0], x[1], ..., ???]\\n\\n               generator\\n                   v\\n[x[0], x[1], x[2], ..., ???]\\n\\n                       StopIteration exception\\n[x[0], x[1], x[2]]     done\\nBasically, whenever the yield statement is encountered, the function pauses and saves its state, then emits \"the next return value in the \\'list\\'\" according to the python iterator protocol (to some syntactic construct like a for-loop that repeatedly calls next() and catches a StopIteration exception, etc.). You might have encountered generators with generator expressions; generator functions are more powerful because you can pass arguments back into the paused generator function, using them to implement coroutines. More on that later.yieldnext()StopIterationgenerator expressionsLet\\'s define a function makeRange that\\'s just like Python\\'s range. Calling makeRange(n) RETURNS A GENERATOR:makeRangerangemakeRange(n)def makeRange(n):\\n    # return 0,1,2,...,n-1\\n    i = 0\\n    while i < n:\\n        yield i\\n        i += 1\\n\\n>>> makeRange(5)\\n<generator object makeRange at 0x19e4aa0>\\nTo force the generator to immediately return its pending values, you can pass it into list() (just like you could any iterable):list()>>> list(makeRange(5))\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\nThe above example can be thought of as merely creating a list which you append to and return:# return a list                  #  # return a generator\\ndef makeRange(n):                #  def makeRange(n):\\n    \"\"\"return [0,1,2,...,n-1]\"\"\" #      \"\"\"return 0,1,2,...,n-1\"\"\"\\n    TO_RETURN = []               # \\n    i = 0                        #      i = 0\\n    while i < n:                 #      while i < n:\\n        TO_RETURN += [i]         #          yield i\\n        i += 1                   #          i += 1\\n    return TO_RETURN             # \\n\\n>>> makeRange(5)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\nThere is one major difference, though; see the last section.An iterable is the last part of a list comprehension, and all generators are iterable, so they\\'re often used like so:#                  < ITERABLE >\\n>>> [x+10 for x in makeRange(5)]\\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\nTo get a better feel for generators, you can play around with the itertools module (be sure to use chain.from_iterable rather than chain when warranted). For example, you might even use generators to implement infinitely-long lazy lists like itertools.count(). You could implement your own def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable), or alternatively do so with the yield keyword in a while-loop.itertoolschain.from_iterablechainitertools.count()def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable)yieldPlease note: generators can actually be used for many more things, such as implementing coroutines or non-deterministic programming or other elegant things. However, the \"lazy lists\" viewpoint I present here is the most common use you will find.implementing coroutinesThis is how the \"Python iteration protocol\" works. That is, what is going on when you do list(makeRange(5)). This is what I describe earlier as a \"lazy, incremental list\".list(makeRange(5))>>> x=iter(range(5))\\n>>> next(x)  # calls x.__next__(); x.next() is deprecated\\n0\\n>>> next(x)\\n1\\n>>> next(x)\\n2\\n>>> next(x)\\n3\\n>>> next(x)\\n4\\n>>> next(x)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nStopIteration\\nThe built-in function next() just calls the objects .__next__() function, which is a part of the \"iteration protocol\" and is found on all iterators. You can manually use the next() function (and other parts of the iteration protocol) to implement fancy things, usually at the expense of readability, so try to avoid doing that...next().__next__()next()Coroutine example:Coroutinedef interactiveProcedure():\\n    userResponse = yield makeQuestionWebpage()\\n    print(\\'user response:\\', userResponse)\\n    yield \\'success\\'\\n\\ncoroutine = interactiveProcedure()\\nwebFormData = next(coroutine)  # same as .send(None)\\nuserResponse = serveWebForm(webFormData)\\n\\n# ...at some point later on web form submit...\\n\\nsuccessStatus = coroutine.send(userResponse)\\nA coroutine (generators which generally accept input via the yield keyword e.g. nextInput = yield nextOutput, as a form of two-way communication) is basically a computation which is allowed to pause itself and request input (e.g. to what it should do next). When the coroutine pauses itself (when the running coroutine eventually hits a yield keyword), the computation is paused and control is inverted (yielded) back to the \\'calling\\' function (the frame which requested the next value of the computation). The paused generator/coroutine remains paused until another invoking function (possibly a different function/context) requests the next value to unpause it (usually passing input data to direct the paused logic interior to the coroutine\\'s code).yieldnextInput = yield nextOutputyieldnextYou can think of python coroutines as lazy incrementally-pending lists, where the next element doesn\\'t just depend on the previous computation, but also on input you may opt to inject during the generation process.Normally, most people would not care about the following distinctions and probably want to stop reading here.In Python-speak, an iterable is any object which \"understands the concept of a for-loop\" like a list [1,2,3], and an iterator is a specific instance of the requested for-loop like [1,2,3].__iter__(). A generator is exactly the same as any iterator, except for the way it was written (with function syntax).[1,2,3][1,2,3].__iter__()When you request an iterator from a list, it creates a new iterator. However, when you request an iterator from an iterator (which you would rarely do), it just gives you a copy of itself.Thus, in the unlikely event that you are failing to do something like this...> x = myRange(5)\\n> list(x)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n> list(x)\\n[]\\n... then remember that a generator is an iterator; that is, it is one-time-use. If you want to reuse it, you should call myRange(...) again. If you need to use the result twice, convert the result to a list and store it in a variable x = list(myRange(5)). Those who absolutely need to clone a generator (for example, who are doing terrifyingly hackish metaprogramming) can use itertools.tee (still works in Python 3) if absolutely necessary, since the copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal has been deferred.myRange(...)x = list(myRange(5))itertools.teeitertools.teestill works in Python 3copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal',\n",

              "   \"There is one type of answer that I don't feel has been given yet, among the many great answers that describe how to use generators. Here is the programming language theory answer:The yield statement in Python returns a generator. A generator in Python is a function that returns continuations (and specifically a type of coroutine, but continuations represent the more general mechanism to understand what is going on).yieldContinuations in programming languages theory are a much more fundamental kind of computation, but they are not often used, because they are extremely hard to reason about and also very difficult to implement. But the idea of what a continuation is, is straightforward: it is the state of a computation that has not yet finished. In this state, the current values of variables, the operations that have yet to be performed, and so on, are saved. Then at some point later in the program the continuation can be invoked, such that the program's variables are reset to that state and the operations that were saved are carried out.Continuations, in this more general form, can be implemented in two ways. In the call/cc way, the program's stack is literally saved and then when the continuation is invoked, the stack is restored.call/ccIn continuation passing style (CPS), continuations are just normal functions (only in languages where functions are first class) which the programmer explicitly manages and passes around to subroutines. In this style, program state is represented by closures (and the variables that happen to be encoded in them) rather than variables that reside somewhere on the stack. Functions that manage control flow accept continuation as arguments (in some variations of CPS, functions may accept multiple continuations) and manipulate control flow by invoking them by simply calling them and returning afterwards. A very simple example of continuation passing style is as follows:def save_file(filename):\\n  def write_file_continuation():\\n    write_stuff_to_file(filename)\\n\\n  check_if_file_exists_and_user_wants_to_overwrite(write_file_continuation)\\nIn this (very simplistic) example, the programmer saves the operation of actually writing the file into a continuation (which can potentially be a very complex operation with many details to write out), and then passes that continuation (i.e, as a first-class closure) to another operator which does some more processing, and then calls it if necessary. (I use this design pattern a lot in actual GUI programming, either because it saves me lines of code or, more importantly, to manage control flow after GUI events trigger.)The rest of this post will, without loss of generality, conceptualize continuations as CPS, because it is a hell of a lot easier to understand and read.Now let's talk about generators in Python. Generators are a specific subtype of continuation. Whereas continuations are able in general to save the state of a computation (i.e., the program's call stack), generators are only able to save the state of iteration over an iterator. Although, this definition is slightly misleading for certain use cases of generators. For instance:def f():\\n  while True:\\n    yield 4\\nThis is clearly a reasonable iterable whose behavior is well defined -- each time the generator iterates over it, it returns 4 (and does so forever). But it isn't probably the prototypical type of iterable that comes to mind when thinking of iterators (i.e., for x in collection: do_something(x)). This example illustrates the power of generators: if anything is an iterator, a generator can save the state of its iteration.for x in collection: do_something(x)To reiterate: Continuations can save the state of a program's stack and generators can save the state of iteration. This means that continuations are more a lot powerful than generators, but also that generators are a lot, lot easier. They are easier for the language designer to implement, and they are easier for the programmer to use (if you have some time to burn, try to read and understand this page about continuations and call/cc).this page about continuations and call/ccBut you could easily implement (and conceptualize) generators as a simple, specific case of continuation passing style:Whenever yield is called, it tells the function to return a continuation.  When the function is called again, it starts from wherever it left off. So, in pseudo-pseudocode (i.e., not pseudocode, but not code) the generator's next method is basically as follows:yieldnextclass Generator():\\n  def __init__(self,iterable,generatorfun):\\n    self.next_continuation = lambda:generatorfun(iterable)\\n\\n  def next(self):\\n    value, next_continuation = self.next_continuation()\\n    self.next_continuation = next_continuation\\n    return value\\nwhere the yield keyword is actually syntactic sugar for the real generator function, basically something like:yielddef generatorfun(iterable):\\n  if len(iterable) == 0:\\n    raise StopIteration\\n  else:\\n    return (iterable[0], lambda:generatorfun(iterable[1:]))\\nRemember that this is just pseudocode and the actual implementation of generators in Python is more complex. But as an exercise to understand what is going on, try to use continuation passing style to implement generator objects without use of the yield keyword.yield\",\n",

The values of its local variables are never seen again.With a yield function, when its code begins to run (i.e. after the function is called, returning a generator object, whose next() method is then invoked), it similarly puts its local variables onto the stack and computes for a while. But then, when it hits the yield statement, before clearing its part of the stack and returning, it takes a snapshot of its local variables and stores them in the generator object. It also writes down the place where it's currently up to in its code (i.e. the particular yield statement).yieldnext()yieldyieldSo it's a kind of a frozen function that the generator is hanging onto.When next() is called subsequently, it retrieves the function's belongings onto the stack and re-animates it.

Streaming parsers in particular will choke.It\\'s an interesting curiosity, but you should really not be using it for anything at all. Below is the original answer.I\\'ve found a little hack that allows you to place comments in a JSON file that will not affect the parsing, or alter the data being represented in any way.It appears that when declaring an object literal you can specify two values with the same key, and the last one takes precedence. Believe it or not, it turns out that JSON parsers work the same way. So we can use this to create comments in the source JSON that will not be present in a parsed object representation. ({a: 1, a: 2});\\n// => Object {a: 2}\\nObject.keys(JSON.parse(\\'{\"a\": 1, \"a\": 2}\\')).length; \\n// => 1\\nIf we apply this technique, your commented JSON file might look like this:{\\n  \"api_host\" : \"The hostname of your API server. You may also specify the port.\",\\n  \"api_host\" : \"hodorhodor.com\",\\n\\n  \"retry_interval\" : \"The interval in seconds between retrying failed API calls\",\\n  \"retry_interval\" : 10,\\n\\n  \"auth_token\" : \"The authentication token.

If you parse it, you\\'ll get an object like this:valid JSON{\\n    \"api_host\": \"hodorhodor.com\",\\n    \"retry_interval\": 10,\\n    \"auth_token\": \"5ad0eb93697215bc0d48a7b69aa6fb8b\",\\n    \"favorite_numbers\": [19,13,53]\\n}\\nWhich means there is no trace of the comments, and they won\\'t have weird side-effects.Happy hacking!',\n",

JSON is defined as a standard by ECMA International. There is always a petition process to have standards revised.

It is simplified even to the point that annotations are unnecessary. It is not even a markup language. The goal is stability and  interoperablilty.Anyone who understands the \"has-a\" relationship of object orientation can understand any JSON structure - that is the whole point. It is just a  directed acyclic graph (DAG) with node tags (key/value pairs), which is a near universal data structure.This only annotation required might be \"//These are DAG tags\". The key names can be as informative as required, allowing arbitrary semantic arity.Any platform can parse JSON with just a few lines of code. XML requires complex OO libraries that are not viable on many platforms.Annotations would just make JSON less interoperable.

              "  'answers': ['The stack is the memory set aside as scratch space for a thread of execution.  When a function is called, a block is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and some bookkeeping data.  When that function returns, the block becomes unused and can be used the next time a function is called.  The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order; the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.  This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack; freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation.  Unlike the stack, there\\'s no enforced pattern to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the heap; you can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.  This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time; there are many custom heap allocators available to tune heap performance for different usage patterns.Each thread gets a stack, while there\\'s typically only one heap for the application (although it isn\\'t uncommon to have multiple heaps for different types of allocation).To answer your questions directly:To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created.  Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.What is their scope?The stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed.  The heap is typically allocated at application startup by the runtime, and is reclaimed when the application (technically process) exits.What determines the size of each of them?The size of the stack is set when a thread is created.  The size of the heap is set on application startup, but can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).What makes one faster?The stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it (a pointer/integer is simply incremented or decremented), while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation.  Also, each byte in the stack tends to be reused very frequently which means it tends to be mapped to the processor\\'s cache, making it very fast. Another performance hit for the heap is that the heap, being mostly a global resource, typically has to be multi-threading safe, i.e. each allocation and deallocation needs to be - typically - synchronized with \"all\" other heap accesses in the program.A clear demonstration:\\n\\nImage source: vikashazrati.wordpress.comvikashazrati.wordpress.com',\n",

              "   'The most important point is that heap and stack are generic terms for ways in which memory can be allocated.  They can be implemented in many different ways, and the terms apply to the basic concepts.In a stack of items, items sit one on top of the other in the order they were placed there, and you can only remove the top one (without toppling the whole thing over).The simplicity of a stack is that you do not need to maintain a table containing a record of each section of allocated memory; the only state information you need is a single pointer to the end of the stack.  To allocate and de-allocate, you just increment and decrement that single pointer.  Note: a stack can sometimes be implemented to start at the top of a section of memory and extend downwards rather than growing upwards.In a heap, there is no particular order to the way items are placed.  You can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear \\'top\\' item.Heap allocation requires maintaining a full record of what memory is allocated and what isn\\'t, as well as some overhead maintenance to reduce fragmentation, find contiguous memory segments big enough to fit the requested size, and so on.  Memory can be deallocated at any time leaving free space.  Sometimes a memory allocator will perform maintenance tasks such as defragmenting memory by moving allocated memory around, or garbage collecting - identifying at runtime when memory is no longer in scope and deallocating it. These images should do a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a heap.  Yum!To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?As mentioned, heap and stack are general terms, and can be implemented in many ways.  Computer programs typically have a stack called a call stack which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called from, and any local variables.  Because functions call other functions and then return, the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call stack.  A program doesn\\'t really have runtime control over it; it\\'s determined by the programming language, OS and even the system architecture.call stackA heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and randomly; i.e. out of order.  The memory is typically allocated by the OS, with the application calling API functions to do this allocation.  There is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated memory, which is usually handled by the runtime code of the programming language or environment used.What is their scope?The call stack is such a low level concept that it doesn\\'t relate to \\'scope\\' in the sense of programming.  If you disassemble some code you\\'ll see relative pointer style references to portions of the stack, but as far as a higher level language is concerned, the language imposes its own rules of scope.  One important aspect of a stack, however, is that once a function returns, anything local to that function is immediately freed from the stack.  That works the way you\\'d expect it to work given how your programming languages work.  In a heap, it\\'s also difficult to define.  The scope is whatever is exposed by the OS, but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a \"scope\" is in your application.  The processor architecture and the OS use virtual addressing, which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page faults, etc.  They keep track of what pages belong to which applications.  You never really need to worry about this, though, because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free memory, and check for errors (if the allocation/freeing fails for any reason).What determines the size of each of them?Again, it depends on the language, compiler, operating system and architecture.  A stack is usually pre-allocated, because by definition it must be contiguous memory.  The language compiler or the OS determine its size.  You don\\'t store huge chunks of data on the stack, so it\\'ll be big enough that it should never be fully used, except in cases of unwanted endless recursion (hence, \"stack overflow\") or other unusual programming decisions.A heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically allocated.  Depending on which way you look at it, it is constantly changing size.  In modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted anyway, so you don\\'t normally need to worry much about how it works deep down, except that (in languages where it lets you) you mustn\\'t use memory that you haven\\'t allocated yet or memory that you have freed.What makes one faster?The stack is faster because all free memory is always contiguous.  No list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free memory, just a single pointer to the current top of the stack.  Compilers usually store this pointer in a special, fast register for this purpose.  What\\'s more, subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of memory, which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor on-die caches.register',\n",

However, here is a simplified explanation.newmallocCan a function be allocated on the heap instead of a stack?No, activation records for functions (i.e. local or automatic variables) are allocated on the stack that is used not only to store these variables, but also to keep track of nested function calls.How the heap is managed is really up to the runtime environment. C uses malloc and C++ uses new, but many other languages have garbage collection.mallocnewHowever, the stack is a more low-level feature closely tied to the processor architecture. Growing the heap when there is not enough space isn't too hard since it can be implemented in the library call that handles the heap. However, growing the stack is often impossible as the stack overflow only is discovered when it is too late; and shutting down the thread of execution is the only viable option.\",\n",

Generally we think of local scope (can only be accessed by the current function) versus global scope (can be accessed anywhere) although scope can get much more complex.Lifetime refers to when a variable is allocated and deallocated during program execution. Usually we think of static allocation (variable will persist through the entire duration of the program, making it useful for storing the same information across several function calls) versus automatic allocation (variable only persists during a single call to a function, making it useful for storing information that is only used during your function and can be discarded once you are done) versus dynamic allocation (variables whose duration is defined at runtime, instead of compile time like static or automatic).Although most compilers and interpreters implement this behavior similarly in terms of using stacks, heaps, etc, a compiler may sometimes break these conventions if it wants as long as behavior is correct. For instance, due to optimization a local variable may only exist in a register or be removed entirely, even though most local variables exist in the stack. As has been pointed out in a few comments, you are free to implement a compiler that doesn\\'t even use a stack or a heap, but instead some other storage mechanisms (rarely done, since stacks and heaps are great for this).I will provide some simple annotated C code to illustrate all of this. The best way to learn is to run a program under a debugger and watch the behavior.

Such variables can make our common but informal naming habits very confusing. For instance when we say \"local\" we usually mean \"locally scoped automatically allocated variable\" and when we say global we usually mean \"globally scoped statically allocated variable\". Unfortunately when it comes to things like \"file scoped statically allocated variables\" many people just say... \"huh???\".Some of the syntax choices in C/C++ exacerbate this problem - for instance many people think global variables are not \"static\" because of the syntax shown below.int var1; // Has global scope and static allocation\\nstatic int var2; // Has file scope and static allocation\\n\\nint main() {return 0;}\\nNote that putting the keyword \"static\" in the declaration above prevents var2 from having global scope. Nevertheless, the global var1 has static allocation. This is not intuitive! For this reason, I try to never use the word \"static\" when describing scope, and instead say something like \"file\" or \"file limited\" scope. However many people use the phrase \"static\" or \"static scope\" to describe a variable that can only be accessed from one code file. In the context of lifetime, \"static\" always means the variable is allocated at program start and deallocated when program exits.Some people think of these concepts as C/C++ specific. They are not. For instance, the Python sample below illustrates all three types of allocation (there are some subtle differences possible in interpreted languages that I won\\'t get into here).from datetime import datetime\\n\\nclass Animal:\\n    _FavoriteFood = \\'Undefined\\' # _FavoriteFood is statically allocated\\n\\n    def PetAnimal(self):\\n        curTime = datetime.time(datetime.now()) # curTime is automatically allocatedion\\n        print(\"Thank you for petting me.

Some info (such as where to go on return) is also stored there.\\nWhen you declare a variable inside your function, that variable is also allocated on the stack. Deallocating the stack is pretty simple because you always deallocate in the reverse order in which you allocate. Stack stuff is added as you enter functions, the corresponding data is removed as you exit them. This means that you tend to stay within a small region of the stack unless you call lots of functions that call lots of other functions (or create a recursive solution).The Heap\\nThe heap is a generic name for where you put the data that you create on the fly. If you don't know how many spaceships your program is going to create, you are likely to use the new (or malloc or equivalent) operator to create each spaceship. This allocation is going to stick around for a while, so it is likely we will free things in a different order than we created them. Thus, the heap is far more complex, because there end up being regions of memory that are unused interleaved with chunks that are - memory gets fragmented. Finding free memory of the size you need is a difficult problem. This is why the heap should be avoided (though it is still often used).Implementation\\nImplementation of both the stack and heap is usually down to the runtime / OS. Often games and other applications that are performance critical create their own memory solutions that grab a large chunk of memory from the heap and then dish it out internally to avoid relying on the OS for memory. This is only practical if your memory usage is quite different from the norm - i.e for games where you load a level in one huge operation and can chuck the whole lot away in another huge operation.Physical location in memory\\nThis is less relevant than you think because of a technology called Virtual Memory which makes your program think that you have access to a certain address where the physical data is somewhere else (even on the hard disc!). The addresses you get for the stack are in increasing order as your call tree gets deeper. The addresses for the heap are un-predictable (i.e implimentation specific) and frankly not important.Virtual Memory\",\n",

A common situation in which you have more than one stack is if you have more than one thread in a process.  In this case each thread has its own stack. You can also have more than one heap, for example some DLL configurations can result in different DLLs allocating from different heaps, which is why it's generally a bad idea to release memory allocated by a different library.In C you can get the benefit of variable length allocation through the use of alloca, which allocates on the stack, as opposed to alloc, which allocates on the heap. This memory won't survive your return statement, but it's useful for a scratch buffer.allocaMaking a huge temporary buffer on Windows that you don't use much of is not free. This is because the compiler will generate a stack probe loop that is called every time your function is entered to make sure the stack exists (because Windows uses a single guard page at the end of your stack to detect when it needs to grow the stack. If you access memory more than one page off the end of the stack you will crash).

The Memory Management Glossary web page has a diagram of this memory layout.mmap()Memory Management GlossaryThe stack and heap are traditionally located at opposite ends of the process's virtual address space. The stack grows automatically when accessed, up to a size set by the kernel (which can be adjusted with setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, ...)). The heap grows when the memory allocator invokes the brk() or sbrk() system call, mapping more pages of physical memory into the process's virtual address space.setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, ...)brk()sbrk()In systems without virtual memory, such as some embedded systems, the same basic layout often applies, except the stack and heap are fixed in size. However, in other embedded systems (such as those based on Microchip PIC microcontrollers), the program stack is a separate block of memory that is not addressable by data movement instructions, and can only be modified or read indirectly through program flow instructions (call, return, etc.).

When it comes to object variables, these are merely references (pointers) to the actual objects on the heap.\\nEvery time an object is instantiated, a chunk of heap memory is set aside to hold the data (state) of that object.

It's the region of memory below the stack pointer register, which can be set as needed.  The stack is also used for passing arguments to subroutines, and also for preserving the values in registers before calling subroutines.The heap is a portion of memory that is given to an application by the operating system, typically through a syscall like malloc.  On modern OSes this memory is a set of pages that only the calling process has access to.The size of the stack is determined at runtime, and generally does not grow after the program launches.  In a C program, the stack needs to be large enough to hold every variable declared within each function.  The heap will grow dynamically as needed, but the OS is ultimately making the call (it will often grow the heap by more than the value requested by malloc, so that at least some future mallocs won't need to go back to the kernel to get more memory.  This behavior is often customizable)Because you've allocated the stack before launching the program, you never need to malloc before you can use the stack, so that's a slight advantage there.  In practice, it's very hard to predict what will be fast and what will be slow in modern operating systems that have virtual memory subsystems, because how the pages are implemented and where they are stored is an implementation detail.  \",\n",

Every time a function declares a new variable, it is \"pushed\" onto the stack. Then every time a function exits, all of the variables pushed onto the stack by that function, are freed (that is to say, they are deleted). Once a stack variable is freed, that region of memory becomes available for other stack variables.The advantage of using the stack to store variables, is that memory is managed for you. You don\\'t have to allocate memory by hand, or free it once you don\\'t need it any more.

It is a more free-floating region of memory (and is larger). To allocate memory on the heap, you must use malloc() or calloc(), which are built-in C functions.

As we will see in the debugging section, there is a tool called Valgrind that can help you detect memory leaks.ValgrindUnlike the stack, the heap does not have size restrictions on variable size (apart from the obvious physical limitations of your computer). Heap memory is slightly slower to be read from and written to, because one has to use pointers to access memory on the heap. We will talk about pointers shortly.Unlike the stack, variables created on the heap are accessible by any function, anywhere in your program. Heap variables are essentially global in scope.More can be found here.hereVariables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast, and its allocation is dealt with when the program is compiled. When a function or a method calls another function which in turns calls another function, etc., the execution of all those functions remains suspended until the very last function returns its value. The stack is always reserved in a LIFO order, the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed. This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack, freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower, but the heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory. Elements of the heap have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time. You can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.

It is reserved for called function parameters and for all temporary variables used in functions.There are two heaps: public and private.The private heap begins on a 16-byte boundary (for 64-bit programs) or a 8-byte boundary (for 32-bit programs) after the last byte of code in your program, and then increases in value from there. It is also called the default heap.If the private heap gets too large it will overlap the stack area, as will the stack overlap the heap if it gets too big. Because the stack starts at a higher address and works its way down to lower address, with proper hacking you can get make the stack so large that it will overrun the private heap area and overlap the code area. The trick then is to overlap enough of the code area that you can hook into the code. It\\'s a little tricky to do and you risk a program crash, but it\\'s easy and very effective.The public heap resides in it\\'s own memory space outside of your program image space. It is this memory that will be siphoned off onto the hard disk if memory resources get scarce.2) To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?The stack is controlled by the programmer, the private heap is managed by the OS, and the public heap is not controlled by anyone because it is an OS service -- you make requests and either they are granted or denied.2b) What is their scope?They are all global to the program, but their contents can be private, public, or global.2c) What determines the size of each of them?The size of the stack and the private heap are determined by your compiler runtime options.

              "   'Where and what are they (physically in a real computer\\'s memory)?ANSWER: Both are in RAM.ASIDE:RAM is like a desk and HDDs/SSDs (permanent storage) are like bookshelves. To read anything, you must have a book open on your desk, and you can only have as many books open as fit on your desk. To get a book, you pull it from your bookshelf and open it on your desk. To return a book, you close the book on your desk and return it to its bookshelf.Stack and heap are names we give to two ways compilers store different kinds of data in the same place (i.e. in RAM).What is their scope?\\nWhat determines the size of each of them?\\nWhat makes one faster?ANSWER:The stack is for static (fixed size) dataa. At compile time, the compiler reads the variable types used in your code.i. It allocates a fixed amount of memory for these variables.\\nii. This size of this memory cannot grow.b. The memory is contiguous (a single block), so access is sometimes faster than the heapc. An object placed on the stack that grows in memory during runtime beyond the size of the stack causes a stack overflow errorThe heap is for dynamic (changing size) dataa. The amount of memory is limited only by the amount of empty space available in RAM\\ni. The amount used can grow or shrink as needed at runtimeb. Since items are allocated on the heap by finding empty space wherever it exists in RAM, data is not always in a contiguous section, which sometimes makes access slower than the stackc. Programmers manually put items on the heap with the new keyword and MUST manually deallocate this memory when they are finished using it.\\ni. Code that repeatedly allocates new memory without deallocating it when it is no longer needed leads to a memory leak.newASIDE:The stack and heap were not primarily introduced to improve speed; they were introduced to handle memory overflow. The first concern regarding use of the stack vs. the heap should be whether memory overflow will occur. If an object is intended to grow in size to an unknown amount (like a linked list or an object whose members can hold an arbitrary amount of data), place it on the heap. As far as possible, use the C++ standard library (STL) containers vector, map, and list as they are memory and speed efficient and added to make your life easier (you don\\'t need to worry about memory allocation/deallocation).After getting your code to run, if you find it is running unacceptably slow, then go back and refactor your code and see if it can be programmed more efficiently. It may turn out the problem has nothing to do with the stack or heap directly at all (e.g. use an iterative algorithm instead of a recursive one, look at I/O vs. CPU-bound tasks, perhaps add multithreading or multiprocessing).I say sometimes slower/faster above because the speed of the program might not have anything to do with items being allocated on the stack or heap.To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?ANSWER:The stack size is determined at compile time by the compiler.The heap size varies during runtime. (The heap works with the OS during runtime to allocate memory.)ASIDE:Below is a little more about control and compile-time vs. runtime operations.Each computer has a unique instruction set architecture (ISA), which are its hardware commands (e.g. \"MOVE\", \"JUMP\", \"ADD\", etc.).An OS is nothing more than a resource manager (controls how/when/ and where to use memory, processors, devices, and information).The ISA of the OS is called the bare machine and the remaining commands are called the extended machine. The kernel is the first layer of the extended machine. It controls things likeWhen we say \"compiler\", we generally mean the compiler, assembler, and linker togetherThe machine code gets passed to the kernel when executed, which determines when it should run and take control, but the machine code itself contains ISA commands for requesting files, requesting memory, etc. So the code issues ISA commands, but everything has to pass by the kernel.',\n",

              "   'I feel most answers are very convoluted and technical, while I didn\\'t find one that could explain simply the reasoning behind those two concepts (i.e. why people created them in the first place?) and why you should care. Here is my attempt at one:That\\'s it.\\xa0\\xa0Still, for more explanations :The stack is meant to be used as the ephemeral or working memory, a memory space that we know will be entirely deleted regularly no matter what mess we put in there during the lifetime of our program. That\\'s like the memo on your desk that you scribble on with anything going through your mind that you barely feel may be important, which you know you will just throw away at the end of the day because you will have filtered and organized the actual important notes in another medium, like a document or a book. We don\\'t care for presentation, crossing-outs or unintelligible text, this is just for our work of the day and will remember what we meant an hour or two ago, it\\'s just our quick and dirty way to store ideas we want to remember later without hurting our current stream of thoughts. That\\'s what people mean by \"the stack is the scratchpad\".The heap however is the long-term memory, the actual important document that will we stored, consulted and depended on for a very long time after its creation. It consequently needs to have perfect form and strictly contain the important data. That why it costs a lot to make and can\\'t be used for the use-case of our precedent memo. It wouldn\\'t be worthwhile, or even simply useless, to take all my notes in an academic paper presentation, writing the text as calligraphy. However this presentation is extremely useful for well curated data. That\\'s what the heap is meant to be. Well known data, important for the lifetime application, which is well controlled and needed at many places in your code. The system will thus never delete this precious data without you explicitly asking for it, because it knows \"that\\'s where the important data is!\".This is why you need to manage and take care of memory allocation on the heap, but don\\'t need to bother with it for the stack.Most top answers are merely technical details of the actual implementations of that concept in real computers.So what to take away from this is that:Unimportant, working, temporary, data just needed to make our functions and objects work is (generally) more relevant to be stored on the stack.Important, permanent and foundational application data is (generally) more relevant to be stored on the heap.This of course needs to be thought of only in the context of the lifetime of your program. Actual humanly important data generated by your program will need to be stored on an external file evidently. (Since whether it is the heap or the stack, they are both cleared entirely when your program terminates.)PS: Those are just general rules, you can always find edge cases and each language comes with its own implementation and resulting quirks, this is meant to be taken as a guidance to the concept and a rule of thumb.',\n",

              "   'CPU stack and heap are physically related to how CPU and registers works with memory, how machine-assembly language works, not high-level languages themselves, even if these languages can decide little things.All modern CPUs work with the \"same\" microprocessor theory: they are all based on what\\'s called \"registers\" and some are for \"stack\" to gain performance. All CPUs have stack registers since the beginning and they had been always here, way of talking, as I know. Assembly languages are the same since the beginning, despite variations... up to Microsoft and its Intermediate Language (IL) that changed the paradigm to have a OO virtual machine assembly language. So we\\'ll be able to have some CLI/CIL CPU in the future (one project of MS).CPUs have stack registers to speed up memories access, but they are limited compared to the use of others registers to get full access to all the available memory for the processus. It why we talked about stack and heap allocations.In summary, and in general, the heap is hudge and slow and is for \"global\" instances and objects content, as the stack is little and fast and for \"local\" variables and references (hidden pointers to forget to manage them).So when we use the new keyword in a method, the reference (an int) is created in the stack, but the object and all its content (value-types as well as objects) is created in the heap, if I remember. But local elementary value-types and arrays are created in the stack.The difference in memory access is at the cells referencing level: addressing the heap, the overall memory of the process, requires more complexity in terms of handling CPU registers, than the stack which is \"more\" locally in terms of addressing because the CPU stack register is used as base address, if I remember.It is why when we have very long or infinite recurse calls or loops, we got stack overflow quickly, without freezing the system on modern computers...C# Heap(ing) Vs Stack(ing) In .NETC# Heap(ing) Vs Stack(ing) In .NETStack vs Heap: Know the Difference Stack vs Heap: Know the Difference Static class memory allocation where it is stored C#Static class memory allocation where it is stored C#What and where are the stack and heap?What and where are the stack and heap?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_managementhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_managementhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_registerhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_registerAssembly language resources:Assembly Programming TutorialAssembly Programming TutorialIntel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer ManualsIntel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals',\n",

You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.JavaScript strict modeECMAScript 5'use strict';\\nWhen a JavaScript engine sees this directive, it will start to interpret the code in a special mode. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode).Consider this example:var a = 365;\\nvar b = 030;\\nIn their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable b with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value 24 (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.b24For a non-exhaustive list of specialties in strict mode, see this answer.this answer'use strict';In my new JavaScript application: Absolutely! Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.In my existing JavaScript code: Probably not! If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. If you want strict mode, you should be prepared to debug and correct your existing code. This is why using 'use strict'; does not suddenly make your code better.'use strict';Insert a 'use strict'; statement on top of your script:'use strict'; // File: myscript.js\\n\\n 'use strict';\\n var a = 2;\\n ....\\nNote that everything in the file myscript.js will be interpreted in strict mode.myscript.jsOr, insert a 'use strict'; statement on top of your function body:'use strict'; function doSomething() {\\n     'use strict';\\n     ...\\n }\\nEverything in the lexical scope of function doSomething will be interpreted in strict mode. The word lexical scope is important here. For example, if your strict code calls a function of a library that is not strict, only your code is executed in strict mode, and not the called function. See this answer for a better explanation.doSomethingthis answerI found a nice article describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):nice articleHistorically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions\\nare scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some\\nfeatures make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is\\nconfusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.\\nMisunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.\\nStatic scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile\\ntime, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be\\ndeferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance\\npenalty.Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.\\nThat means that the features that previously required dynamic binding\\nmust be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is\\neliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the\\nenvironment of its caller is severely restricted.One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like YUI Compressor\\ncan do a better job when processing it.YUI CompressorJavaScript has implied global variables. If\\nyou do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is\\nimplicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for\\nbeginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping\\nchores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more\\ndifficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict\\nmode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should\\nexplicitly declare all of your variables.There are a number of situations that could cause this\\nto be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to\\nprovide the new prefix when calling a constructor function, the\\nconstructor's this will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so\\ninstead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently\\ntampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will\\ninstead bind this to undefined, which will cause the constructor to\\nthrow an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much\\nsooner.thisnewthisthisundefinedJavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you\\ncould not create them yourself until ES5’s Object.createProperty\\nfunction exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value\\nto a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would\\nnot change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as\\nthough it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to\\ngo into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a\\nread-only property will throw an exception.Object.createPropertyThe octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely\\nuseful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word\\nsizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC\\n6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read\\noctal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented\\nthe op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the\\nslow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was\\nthought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was\\nselected: Leading zero. So in C, 0100 means 64, not 100, and 08 is an\\nerror, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been\\ncopied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where\\nit is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in\\nstrict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.010008The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more\\narray-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its callee and caller\\nproperties. This makes it possible to pass your arguments to untrusted\\ncode without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the\\narguments property of functions is eliminated.calleecallerargumentsargumentsIn strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a\\nsyntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.\\nA function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its\\nparameters. A function can’t delete its own variables. An attempt to\\ndelete a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive\\nvalues are not implicitly wrapped.deletedeleteECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words.

In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.\\nThat means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.Now let\\'s write the same function in strict mode.\"use strict\"\\nfunction getname(){\\n    name = \"Stack Overflow\"; // Not using var keyword\\n    return name;\\n}\\ngetname();\\nconsole.log(name); \\nWe will get the following error.Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined\\nat getname (<anonymous>:3:15)\\nat <anonymous>:6:5\\nHere, the compiler throws the reference error. In strict mode, the compiler does not allow us to use the variable without declaring it. So memory leaks can be prevented. In addition, we can write more optimized code.',\n",
              "   'Strict mode eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, thus making javascript “more secured”.Is it considered among best practices?Yes, It\\'s considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include Strict mode. This is done by adding the below line of code in your JS file.\\'use strict\\'; \\'use strict\\'; in your code.What does it mean to user agents?Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn\\'t make sense.For example: Consider in your .js file you have the following code:.jsScenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]var city = \"Chicago\"\\nconsole.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago\\nScenario 2: [NO STRICT MODE]city = \"Chicago\"\\nconsole.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago\\nSo why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don\\'t want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that\\'s where strict mode helps out.Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]\\'use strict\\';\\n\\ncity = \"Chicago\"\\nconsole.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.\\nAdditional tip: To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don\\'t need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple .js file. You can enforce this rule globally in eslint rules as follows:.jseslintFilename: .eslintrc.js.eslintrc.jsmodule.exports = {\\n    env: {\\n        es6: true\\n    },\\n    rules : {\\n        strict: [\\'error\\', \\'global\\'],\\n        },\\n    };\\n    \\nOkay, so what is prevented in strict mode?Using a variable without declaring it will throw an error in strict mode. This is to prevent unintentionally creating global variables throughout your application. The example with printing Chicago covers this in particular.Deleting a variable or a function or an argument is a no-no in strict mode.\"use strict\";\\n function x(p1, p2) {}; \\n delete x; // This will cause an error\\nDuplicating a parameter name is not allowed in strict mode. \"use strict\";\\n function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error\\nReserved words in the Javascript language are not allowed in strict mode. The words are implements interface, let, packages, private, protected, public. static, and yieldFor a more comprehensive list check out the MDN documentation here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_modehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode',\n",

Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard), then the latter script will trigger the former to run at import time and using the second script\\'s command line arguments. This is almost always a mistake.import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guardIf you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then__name__it executes all of the code found in the file.Let\\'s see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.__name__Let\\'s use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called foo.py.foo.py# Suppose this is foo.py.\\n\\nprint(\"before import\")\\nimport math\\n\\nprint(\"before function_a\")\\ndef function_a():\\n    print(\"Function A\")\\n\\nprint(\"before function_b\")\\ndef function_b():\\n    print(\"Function B {}\".format(math.sqrt(100)))\\n\\nprint(\"before __name__ guard\")\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    function_a()\\n    function_b()\\nprint(\"after __name__ guard\")\\nWhen the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the __name__ variable.__name__When Your Module Is the Main ProgramIf you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.python foo.py\\nthe interpreter will assign the hard-coded string \"__main__\" to the __name__ variable, i.e.\"__main__\"__name__# It\\'s as if the interpreter inserts this at the top\\n# of your module when run as the main program.\\n__name__ = \"__main__\" \\nWhen Your Module Is Imported By AnotherOn the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there\\'s a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:# Suppose this is in some other main program.\\nimport foo\\nThe interpreter will search for your foo.py file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name \"foo\" from the import statement to the __name__ variable, i.e.foo.py\"foo\"__name__# It\\'s as if the interpreter inserts this at the top\\n# of your module when it\\'s imported from another module.\\n__name__ = \"foo\"\\nAfter the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.AlwaysIt prints the string \"before import\" (without quotes).\"before import\"It loads the math module and assigns it to a variable called math. This is equivalent to replacing import math with the following (note that __import__ is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):mathmathimport math__import__# Find and load a module given its string name, \"math\",\\n# then assign it to a local variable called math.\\nmath = __import__(\"math\")\\nIt prints the string \"before function_a\".\"before function_a\"It executes the def block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called function_a.deffunction_aIt prints the string \"before function_b\".\"before function_b\"It executes the second def block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called function_b.deffunction_bIt prints the string \"before __name__ guard\".\"before __name__ guard\"Only When Your Module Is the Main Program__name__\"__main__\"\"Function A\"\"Function B 10.0\"Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another__name__\"foo\"\"__main__\"ifAlways\"after __name__ guard\"SummaryIn summary, here\\'s what\\'d be printed in the two cases:# What gets printed if foo is the main program\\nbefore import\\nbefore function_a\\nbefore function_b\\nbefore __name__ guard\\nFunction A\\nFunction B 10.0\\nafter __name__ guard\\n# What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module\\nbefore import\\nbefore function_a\\nbefore function_b\\nbefore __name__ guard\\nafter __name__ guard\\nYou might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a .py file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:.pyYour module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing .py files like your script and running special test functions.

And this extra complexity would mean you\\'re likely to forget, making your development process more troublesome.The __name__ variable points to the namespace wherever the Python interpreter happens to be at the moment. __name__Inside an imported module, it\\'s the name of that module.

There\\'s a Pythonic way to improve on this, though. What if we want to run this business process from outside the module?If we put the code we want to exercise as we develop and test in a function like this and then do our check for \\'__main__\\' immediately after:\\'__main__\\'def main():\\n    \"\"\"business logic for when running this module as the primary one!\"\"\"\\n    setup()\\n    foo = do_important()\\n    bar = do_even_more_important(foo)\\n    for baz in bar:\\n        do_super_important(baz)\\n    teardown()\\n\\n# Here\\'s our payoff idiom!\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    main()\\nWe now have a final function for the end of our module that will run if we run the module as the primary module.

When you import a module it doesn\\'t just \\'recognize\\' it and wait for further instructions - it actually runs all the executable operations contained within the script. So, putting the meat of your script into the main() function effectively quarantines it, putting it in isolation so that it won\\'t immediately run when imported by another script.main()Again, there will be exceptions, but common practice is that main() doesn\\'t usually get called externally. So you may be wondering one more thing: if we\\'re not calling main(), why are we calling the script at all? It\\'s because many people structure their scripts with standalone functions that are built to be run independent of the rest of the code in the file. They\\'re then later called somewhere else in the body of the script. Which brings me to this:main()main()But the code works without itYes, that\\'s right. These separate functions can be called from an in-line script that\\'s not contained inside a main() function. If you\\'re accustomed (as I am, in my early learning stages of programming) to building in-line scripts that do exactly what you need, and you\\'ll try to figure it out again if you ever need that operation again ... well, you\\'re not used to this kind of internal structure to your code, because it\\'s more complicated to build and it\\'s not as intuitive to read.main()But that\\'s a script that probably can\\'t have its functions called externally, because if it did it would immediately start calculating and assigning variables. And chances are if you\\'re trying to re-use a function, your new script is related closely enough to the old one that there will be conflicting variables.In splitting out independent functions, you gain the ability to re-use your previous work by calling them into another script. For example, \"example.py\" might import \"xy.py\" and call x(), making use of the \\'x\\' function from \"xy.py\".

If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use window.location.href or window.location.assign. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay. But if the page auto redirects then you should use replace so that the user can use the back button without getting forced back to the page the redirect sends.window.location.hrefwindow.location.assignYou can also use meta data to run a page redirect as followed.META Refresh<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;url=http://evil.example/\" />\\nMETA Location<meta http-equiv=\"location\" content=\"URL=http://evil.example\" />\\nBASE Hijacking<base href=\"http://evil.example/\" />\\nMany more methods to redirect your unsuspecting client to a page they may not wish to go can be found on this page (not one of them is reliant on jQuery):https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethodshttps://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethodsI would also like to point out, people don\\'t like to be randomly redirected.

These meanings differ from the intuition many people have when first hearing the terms. Much of the confusion in this discussion seems to come from this fact.precisely definedThe terms \"pass-by-value\" and \"pass-by-reference\" are talking about variables. Pass-by-value means that the value of a variable is passed to a function/method. Pass-by-reference means that a reference to that variable is passed to the function. The latter gives the function a way to change the contents of the variable.By those definitions, Java is always pass-by-value.  Unfortunately, when we deal with variables holding objects we are really dealing with object-handles called references which are passed-by-value as well.  This terminology and semantics easily confuse many beginners.It goes like this:public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    Dog aDog = new Dog(\"Max\");\\n    Dog oldDog = aDog;\\n\\n    // we pass the object to foo\\n    foo(aDog);\\n    // aDog variable is still pointing to the \"Max\" dog when foo(...) returns\\n    aDog.getName().equals(\"Max\"); // true\\n    aDog.getName().equals(\"Fifi\"); // false\\n    aDog == oldDog; // true\\n}\\n\\npublic static void foo(Dog d) {\\n    d.getName().equals(\"Max\"); // true\\n    // change d inside of foo() to point to a new Dog instance \"Fifi\"\\n    d = new Dog(\"Fifi\");\\n    d.getName().equals(\"Fifi\"); // true\\n}\\nIn the example above aDog.getName() will still return \"Max\". The value aDog within main is not changed in the function foo with the Dog \"Fifi\" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return \"Fifi\" after the call to foo.aDog.getName()\"Max\"aDogmainfooDog\"Fifi\"aDog.getName()main\"Fifi\"fooLikewise:public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    Dog aDog = new Dog(\"Max\");\\n    Dog oldDog = aDog;\\n\\n    foo(aDog);\\n    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog has been changed to \"Fifi\"\\n    aDog.getName().equals(\"Fifi\"); // true\\n    // but it is still the same dog:\\n    aDog == oldDog; // true\\n}\\n\\npublic static void foo(Dog d) {\\n    d.getName().equals(\"Max\"); // true\\n    // this changes the name of d to be \"Fifi\"\\n    d.setName(\"Fifi\");\\n}\\nIn the above example, Fifi is the dog\\'s name after call to foo(aDog) because the object\\'s name was set inside of foo(...).

What they call \"references\" act/feel more like what we\\'d call \"pointers\" in most other languages.What that means, is when you haveDog myDog = new Dog(\"Rover\");\\nfoo(myDog);\\nyou\\'re essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.Dogfoo(I say essentially because Java pointers/references aren\\'t direct addresses, but it\\'s easiest to think of them that way.)Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.Dogif the Method were defined aspublic void foo(Dog someDog) {\\n    someDog.setName(\"Max\");     // AAA\\n    someDog = new Dog(\"Fifi\");  // BBB\\n    someDog.setName(\"Rowlf\");   // CCC\\n}\\nlet\\'s look at what\\'s happening.someDogsomeDogDogDogDogDogsomeDogDogDogDogNow let\\'s think about what happens outside the method:Did myDog change?myDogThere\\'s the key.Keeping in mind that myDog is a pointer, and not an actual Dog, the answer is NO. myDog still has the value 42; it\\'s still pointing to the original Dog (but note that because of line \"AAA\", its name is now \"Max\" - still the same Dog; myDog\\'s value has not changed.)myDogDogmyDogDogmyDogIt\\'s perfectly valid to follow an address and change what\\'s at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, the caller will not see any changes you make to where that pointer points. (In a language with pass-by-reference semantics, the method function can change the pointer and the caller will see that change.)In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the foo method we defined above would have changed where myDog was pointing when it assigned someDog on line BBB.foomyDogsomeDogThink of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.A discussion in the comments warrants some clarification...In C, you can writevoid swap(int *x, int *y) {\\n    int t = *x;\\n    *x = *y;\\n    *y = t;\\n}\\n\\nint x = 1;\\nint y = 2;\\nswap(&x, &y);\\nThis is not a special case in C. Both languages use pass-by-value semantics. Here the call site is creating additional data structure to assist the function to access and manipulate data.The function is being passed pointers to data, and follows those pointers to access and modify that data.A similar approach in Java, where the caller sets up assisting structure, might be:void swap(int[] x, int[] y) {\\n    int temp = x[0];\\n    x[0] = y[0];\\n    y[0] = temp;\\n}\\n\\nint[] x = {1};\\nint[] y = {2};\\nswap(x, y);\\n(or if you wanted both examples to demonstrate features the other language doesn\\'t have, create a mutable IntWrapper class to use in place of the arrays)In these cases, both C and Java are simulating pass-by-reference. They\\'re still both passing values (pointers to ints or arrays), and following those pointers inside the called function to manipulate the data.Pass-by-reference is all about the function declaration/definition, and how it handles its parameters. Reference semantics apply to every call to that function, and the call site only needs to pass variables, no additional data structure.These simulations require the call site and the function to cooperate. No doubt it\\'s useful, but it\\'s still pass-by-value.',\n",

The key point is that Java never provides direct access to the values of objects themselves, in any circumstances. The only access to objects is through a reference to that object. Because Java objects are always accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables and method arguments as being objects, when pedantically they are only references to objects. The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.So, when calling a methodintlongSo if you have doSomething(foo) and public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. } the two Foos have copied references that point to the same objects.doSomething(foo)public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. }Naturally, passing by value a reference to an object looks very much like (and is indistinguishable in practice from) passing an object by reference.',\n",

Here\\'s some additional information that will hopefully aid in understanding what\\'s happening in memory.Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:\\nValues go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.\\nMemory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.Okay. First off, local primitives go on the stack. So this code:int x = 3;\\nfloat y = 101.1f;\\nboolean amIAwesome = true;\\nresults in this:When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are against the word \"pointer\". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes on the stack.Like so:int problems = 99;\\nString name = \"Jay-Z\";\\nAn array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.JButton[] marxBros = new JButton[3];\\nmarxBros[0] = new JButton(\"Groucho\");\\nmarxBros[1] = new JButton(\"Zeppo\");\\nmarxBros[2] = new JButton(\"Harpo\");\\nSo, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you\\'re actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the \"value\" of the address, and some say it\\'s just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between \"reference\" and \"value\" proponents. What you call it isn\\'t as important as that you understand that what\\'s getting passed in is the address to the object.private static void shout(String name){\\n    System.out.println(\"There goes \" + name + \"!\");\\n}\\n\\npublic static void main(String[] args){\\n    String hisName = \"John J. Jingleheimerschmitz\";\\n    String myName = hisName;\\n    shout(myName);\\n}\\nOne String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier hisName, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call shout(): a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, name is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.hisNameshout()nameSo, value, reference?

Not sure where the disconnect is, but guessing the c++ example is not clear. I\\'m posting the same example in pascal because I think pass-by-reference looks cleaner in pascal, but I could be wrong. I might just be confusing people more; I hope not.In pascal, parameters passed-by-reference are called \"var parameters\". In the procedure setToNil below, please note the keyword \\'var\\' which precedes the parameter \\'ptr\\'. When a pointer is passed to this procedure, it will be passed by reference. Note the behavior: when this procedure sets ptr to nil (that\\'s pascal speak for NULL), it will set the argument to nil--you can\\'t do that in Java.program passByRefDemo;\\ntype \\n   iptr = ^integer;\\nvar\\n   ptr: iptr;\\n   \\n   procedure setToNil(var ptr : iptr);\\n   begin\\n       ptr := nil;\\n   end;\\n\\nbegin\\n   new(ptr);\\n   ptr^ := 10;\\n   setToNil(ptr);\\n   if (ptr = nil) then\\n       writeln(\\'ptr seems to be nil\\');     { ptr should be nil, so this line will run. }\\nend.\\nEDIT 2Some excerpts from \"THE Java Programming Language\" by Ken Arnold, James Gosling (the guy who invented Java), and David Holmes, chapter 2, section 2.6.5All parameters to methods are passed \"by value\". In other words,\\nvalues of parameter variables in a method are copies of the invoker\\nspecified as arguments.He goes on to make the same point regarding objects . . .You should note that when the parameter is an object reference, it is\\nthe object reference-not the object itself-that is passed \"by value\".And towards the end of the same section he makes a broader statement about java being only pass by value and never pass by reference.The Java programming language does not pass objects by reference; it\\npasses object references by value. Because two copies of the same\\nreference refer to the same actual object, changes made through one\\nreference variable are visible through the other. There is exactly one\\nparameter passing mode-pass by value-and that helps keep things\\nsimple.This section of the book has a great explanation of parameter passing in Java and of the distinction between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value and it\\'s by the creator of Java. I would encourage anyone to read it, especially if you\\'re still not convinced.I think the difference between the two models is very subtle and unless you\\'ve done programming where you actually used pass-by-reference, it\\'s easy to miss where two models differ.I hope this settles the debate, but probably won\\'t.EDIT 3I might be a little obsessed with this post. Probably because I feel that the makers of Java inadvertently spread misinformation. If instead of using the word \"reference\" for pointers they had used something else, say\\ndingleberry, there would\\'ve been no problem. You could say, \"Java passes dingleberries by value and not by reference\", and nobody would be confused.That\\'s the reason only Java developers have issue with this. They look at the word \"reference\" and think they know exactly what that means, so they don\\'t even bother to consider the opposing argument.Anyway, I noticed a comment in an older post, which made a balloon analogy which I really liked. So much so that I decided to glue together some clip-art to make a set of cartoons to illustrate the point.Passing a reference by value--Changes to the reference are not reflected in the caller\\'s scope, but the changes to the object are. This is because the reference is copied, but the both the original and the copy refer to the same object.\\nPass by reference--There is no copy of the reference. Single reference is shared by both the caller and the function being called. Any changes to the reference or the Object\\'s data are reflected in the caller\\'s scope.\\nEDIT 4I have seen posts on this topic which describe the low level implementation of parameter passing in Java, which I think is great and very helpful because it makes an abstract idea concrete. However, to me the question is more about the behavior described in the language specification than about the technical implementation of the behavior. This is an exerpt from the Java Language Specification, section 8.4.1 :Java Language Specification, section 8.4.1When the method or constructor is invoked (§15.12), the values of the\\nactual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\\nvariables, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\\nthe method or constructor. The Identifier that appears in the\\nDeclaratorId may be used as a simple name in the body of the method or\\nconstructor to refer to the formal parameter.Which means, java creates a copy of the passed parameters before executing a method. Like most people who studied compilers in college, I used \"The Dragon Book\" which is THE compilers book. It has a good description of \"Call-by-value\" and \"Call-by-Reference\" in Chapter 1. The Call-by-value description matches up with Java Specs exactly.\"The Dragon Book\"Back when I studied compilers-in the 90\\'s, I used the first edition of the book from 1986 which pre-dated Java by about 9 or 10 years. However, I just ran across a copy of the 2nd Eddition from 2007 which actually mentions Java! Section 1.6.6 labeled \"Parameter Passing Mechanisms\" describes parameter passing pretty nicely. Here is an excerpt under the heading \"Call-by-value\" which mentions Java:2nd EdditionIn call-by-value, the actual parameter is evaluated (if it is an\\nexpression) or copied (if it is a variable). The value is placed in\\nthe location belonging to the corresponding formal parameter of the\\ncalled procedure. This method is used in C and Java, and is a common\\noption in C++ , as well as in most other languages.',\n",

              "   'Java is always pass by value, not pass by referenceFirst of all, we need to understand what pass by value and pass by reference are.Pass by value means that you are making a copy in memory of the actual parameter\\'s value that is passed in. This is a copy of the contents of the actual parameter.Pass by reference (also called pass by address) means that a copy of the address of the actual parameter is stored.Sometimes Java can give the illusion of pass by reference. Let\\'s see how it works by using the example below:public class PassByValue {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        Test t = new Test();\\n        t.name = \"initialvalue\";\\n        new PassByValue().changeValue(t);\\n        System.out.println(t.name);\\n    }\\n    \\n    public void changeValue(Test f) {\\n        f.name = \"changevalue\";\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Test {\\n    String name;\\n}\\nThe output of this program is:changevalue\\nLet\\'s understand step by step:Test t = new Test();\\nAs we all know it will create an object in the heap and return the reference value back to t. For example, suppose the value of t is 0x100234 (we don\\'t know the actual JVM internal value, this is just an example) .0x100234new PassByValue().changeValue(t);\\nWhen passing reference t to the function it will not directly pass the actual reference value of object test,  but it will create a copy of t and then pass it to the function. Since it is passing by value, it passes a copy of the variable rather than the actual reference of it. Since we said the value of t was 0x100234, both t and f will have the same value and hence they will point to the same object.0x100234If you change anything in the function using reference f it will modify the existing contents of the object.

              "   'Getting an outside of the box view, let\\'s look at Assembly or some low level memory management. At the CPU level a reference to anything immediately becomes a value if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why pointer is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).Data in memory has a Location and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a Name to certain Location (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces Name with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.Down to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).Lets say we have a variable Foo, its Location is at the 47th byte in memory and its Value is 5. We have another variable Ref2Foo which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. This Ref2Foo might be a technical variable, not explicitly created by the program. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see just two Values.\\nIf you use them as references then to reach to 5 we have to travel:5(Name)[Location] -> [Value at the Location]\\n---------------------\\n(Ref2Foo)[223]  -> 47\\n(Foo)[47]       -> 5\\nThis is how jump-tables work. If we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo\\'s value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method, depending on the language and its several method invocation modes:In every cases above a value - a copy of an existing value - has been created, it is now upto the receiving method to handle it. When you write \"Foo\" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  dereferenced, or double dereferenced, the process depends on how the language works and/or what the type of Foo dictates. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a reference is a value when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (at language level).Now we have passed Foo to the method:Foo = 9Foo = 11procedure findMin(x, y, z: integer;: integer);4749Foo = 12474747223Ref2Foo22347492234749Ref2FooNitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only pass-by-reference.Strict pass-by-value is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to be copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller\\'s view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.So in short and in Java\\'s own terminology, Java is pass-by-value where value can be: either a real value or a value that is a representation of a reference.

              "   'Unlike some other languages, Java does not allow you to choose between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference—all arguments are passed by value. A method call can pass two types of values to a method—copies of primitive values (e.g., values of int and double) and copies of references to objects.When a method modifies a primitive-type parameter, changes to the parameter have no effect on the original argument value in the calling method.When it comes to objects, objects themselves cannot be passed to methods. So we pass the reference(address) of the object. We can manipulate the original object using this reference.How Java creates and stores objects: When we create an object we store the object’s address in a reference variable. Let\\'s analyze the following statement.Account account1 = new Account();\\n“Account account1” is the type and name of the reference variable, “=” is the assignment operator, “new” asks for the required amount of space from the system. The constructor to the right of keyword new which creates the object is called implicitly by the keyword new. Address of the created object(result of right value, which is an expression called \"class instance creation expression\") is assigned to the left value (which is a reference variable with a name and a type specified) using the assign operator.Although an object’s reference is passed by value, a method can still interact with the referenced object by calling its public methods using the copy of the object’s reference. Since the reference stored in the parameter is a copy of the reference that was passed as an argument, the parameter in the called method and the argument in the calling method refer to the same object in memory.Passing references to arrays, instead of the array objects themselves, makes sense for performance reasons. Because everything in Java is passed by value, if array objects were passed,\\na copy of each element would be passed. For large arrays, this would waste time and consume\\nconsiderable storage for the copies of the elements.In the image below you can see we have two reference variables(These are called pointers in C/C++, and I think that term makes it easier to understand this feature.) in the main method. Primitive and reference variables are kept in stack memory(left side in images below). array1 and array2 reference variables \"point\" (as C/C++ programmers call it) or reference to a and b arrays respectively, which are objects (values these reference variables hold are addresses of objects) in heap memory (right side in images below).If we pass the value of array1 reference variable as an argument to the reverseArray method, a reference variable is created in the method and that reference variable starts pointing to the same array (a). public class Test\\n{\\n    public static void reverseArray(int[] array1)\\n    {\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args)\\n    {\\n        int[] array1 = { 1, 10, -7 };\\n        int[] array2 = { 5, -190, 0 };\\n\\n        reverseArray(array1);\\n    }\\n}\\nSo, if we say array1[0] = 5;\\nin reverseArray method, it will make a change in array a.We have another reference variable in reverseArray method (array2) that points to an array c. If we were to say array1 = array2;\\nin reverseArray method, then the reference variable array1 in method reverseArray would stop pointing to array a and start pointing to array c (Dotted line in second image).If we return value of reference variable array2 as the return value of method reverseArray and assign this value to reference variable array1 in main method, array1 in main will start pointing to array c.So let\\'s write all the things we have done at once now.public class Test\\n{\\n    public static int[] reverseArray(int[] array1)\\n    {\\n        int[] array2 = { -7, 0, -1 };\\n\\n        array1[0] = 5; // array a becomes 5, 10, -7\\n\\n        array1 = array2; /* array1 of reverseArray starts\\n          pointing to c instead of a (not shown in image below) */\\n        return array2;\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args)\\n    {\\n        int[] array1 = { 1, 10, -7 };\\n        int[] array2 = { 5, -190, 0 };\\n\\n        array1 = reverseArray(array1); /* array1 of \\n         main starts pointing to c instead of a */\\n    }\\n}\\nAnd now that reverseArray method is over, its reference variables(array1 and array2) are gone. Which means we now only have the two reference variables in main method array1 and array2 which point to c and b arrays respectively. No reference variable is pointing to object (array) a.

In C, the default convention is pass by value. void foo(int x) passes an int by value. void foo(int *x) is a function that does not want an int a, but a pointer to an int: foo(&a). One would use this with the & operator to pass a variable address.void foo(int x)void foo(int *x)int afoo(&a)&Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: void foo(int &x) is called by foo(a), where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference a should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.void foo(int &x)foo(a)a\",\n",

I was stuck trying to do this myself, so here I'll write down in detail how I did this especially for people who have no experience in Vim!VimI wanted to change my five latest commits that I already pushed to the server. This is quite 'dangerous' because if someone else already pulled from this, you can mess things up by changing the commit messages. However, when you’re working on your own little branch and are sure no one pulled it you can change it like this:Let's say you want to change your five latest commits, and then you type this in the terminal:git rebase -i HEAD~5\\n*Where 5 is the number of commit messages you want to change (so if you want to change the 10th to last commit, you type in 10).This command will get you into Vim there you can ‘edit’ your commit history. You’ll see your last five commits at the top like this:pick <commit hash> commit message\\nInstead of pick you need to write reword. You can do this in Vim by typing in i. That makes you go in to insert mode. (You see that you’re in insert mode by the word INSERT at the bottom.) For the commits you want to change, type in reword instead of pick.pickrewordirewordpickThen you need to save and quit this screen. You do that by first going in to ‘command-mode’ by pressing the Escbutton (you can check that you’re in command-mode if the word INSERT at the bottom has disappeared). Then you can type in a command by typing :. The command to save and quit is wq. So if you type in :wq you’re on the right track.:wq:wqThen Vim will go over every commit message you want to reword, and here you can actually change the commit messages. You’ll do this by going into insert mode, changing the commit message, going into the command-mode, and save and quit. Do this five times and you’re out of Vim!Then, if you already pushed your wrong commits, you need to git push --force to overwrite them. Remember that git push --force is quite a dangerous thing to do, so make sure that no one pulled from the server since you pushed your wrong commits!git push --forcegit push --forceNow you have changed your commit messages!(As you see, I'm not that experienced in Vim, so if I used the wrong 'lingo' to explain what's happening, feel free to correct me!)\",\n",

              "  'answers': ['A closure is a pairing of:A lexical environment is part of every execution context (stack frame) and is a map between identifiers (i.e. local variable names) and values.Every function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer lexical environment. This reference is used to configure the execution context created when a function is invoked. This reference enables code inside the function to \"see\" variables declared outside the function, regardless of when and where the function is called.If a function was called by a function, which in turn was called by another function, then a chain of references to outer lexical environments is created. This chain is called the scope chain.In the following code, inner forms a closure with the lexical environment of the execution context created when foo is invoked, closing over variable secret:innerfoosecretfunction foo() {\\n  const secret = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)\\n  return function inner() {\\n    console.log(`The secret number is ${secret}.`)\\n  }\\n}\\nconst f = foo() // `secret` is not directly accessible from outside `foo`\\nf() // The only way to retrieve `secret`, is to invoke `f`In other words: in JavaScript, functions carry a reference to a private \"box of state\", to which only they (and any other functions declared within the same lexical environment) have access. This box of the state is invisible to the caller of the function, delivering an excellent mechanism for data-hiding and encapsulation.And remember: functions in JavaScript can be passed around like variables (first-class functions), meaning these pairings of functionality and state can be passed around your program: similar to how you might pass an instance of a class around in C++.If JavaScript did not have closures, then more states would have to be passed between functions explicitly, making parameter lists longer and code noisier.So, if you want a function to always have access to a private piece of state, you can use a closure....and frequently we do want to associate the state with a function. For example, in Java or C++, when you add a private instance variable and a method to a class, you are associating the state with functionality.In C and most other common languages, after a function returns, all the local variables are no longer accessible because the stack-frame is destroyed. In JavaScript, if you declare a function within another function, then the local variables of the outer function can remain accessible after returning from it. In this way, in the code above, secret remains available to the function object inner, after it has been returned from foo.secretinnerfooClosures are useful whenever you need a private state associated with a function. This is a very common scenario - and remember: JavaScript did not have a class syntax until 2015, and it still does not have a private field syntax. Closures meet this need.In the following code, the function toString closes over the details of the car.toStringfunction Car(manufacturer, model, year, color) {\\n  return {\\n    toString() {\\n      return `${manufacturer} ${model} (${year}, ${color})`\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst car = new Car(\\'Aston Martin\\', \\'V8 Vantage\\', \\'2012\\', \\'Quantum Silver\\')\\nconsole.log(car.toString())In the following code, the function inner closes over both fn and args.innerfnargsfunction curry(fn) {\\n  const args = []\\n  return function inner(arg) {\\n    if(args.length === fn.length) return fn(...args)\\n    args.push(arg)\\n    return inner\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfunction add(a, b) {\\n  return a + b\\n}\\n\\nconst curriedAdd = curry(add)\\nconsole.log(curriedAdd(2)(3)()) // 5In the following code, function onClick closes over variable BACKGROUND_COLOR.onClickBACKGROUND_COLORconst $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)\\nconst BACKGROUND_COLOR = \\'rgba(200, 200, 242, 1)\\'\\n\\nfunction onClick() {\\n  $(\\'body\\').style.background = BACKGROUND_COLOR\\n}\\n\\n$(\\'button\\').addEventListener(\\'click\\', onClick)<button>Set background color</button>In the following example, all the implementation details are hidden inside an immediately executed function expression. The functions tick and toString close over the private state and functions they need to complete their work. Closures have enabled us to modularize and encapsulate our code.ticktoStringlet namespace = {};\\n\\n(function foo(n) {\\n  let numbers = []\\n\\n  function format(n) {\\n    return Math.trunc(n)\\n  }\\n\\n  function tick() {\\n    numbers.push(Math.random() * 100)\\n  }\\n\\n  function toString() {\\n    return numbers.map(format)\\n  }\\n\\n  n.counter = {\\n    tick,\\n    toString\\n  }\\n}(namespace))\\n\\nconst counter = namespace.counter\\ncounter.tick()\\ncounter.tick()\\nconsole.log(counter.toString())This example shows that the local variables are not copied in the closure: the closure maintains a reference to the original variables themselves. It is as though the stack-frame stays alive in memory even after the outer function exits.function foo() {\\n  let x = 42\\n  let inner = () => console.log(x)\\n  x = x + 1\\n  return inner\\n}\\n\\nfoo()() // logs 43In the following code, three methods log, increment, and update all close over the same lexical environment.logincrementupdateAnd every time createObject is called, a new execution context (stack frame) is created and a completely new variable x, and a new set of functions (log etc.) are created, that close over this new variable.createObjectxlogfunction createObject() {\\n  let x = 42;\\n  return {\\n    log() { console.log(x) },\\n    increment() { x++ },\\n    update(value) { x = value }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst o = createObject()\\no.increment()\\no.log() // 43\\no.update(5)\\no.log() // 5\\nconst p = createObject()\\np.log() // 42If you are using variables declared using var, be careful you understand which variable you are closing over.

Since then, the question has mutated several times, so my answer may now seem incredibly silly & out of place. Hopefully the general idea of the story remains fun for some.I\\'m a big fan of analogy and metaphor when explaining difficult concepts, so let me try my hand with a story.Once upon a time:There was a princess...function princess() {\\nShe lived in a wonderful world full of adventures.

It also covers all the points in the accepted answer, except for the points (1) that functions copy their arguments into local variables (the named function arguments), and (2) that copying numbers creates a new number, but copying an object reference gives you another reference to the same object. These are also good to know but again completely unrelated to closures. It is also very similar to the example in this answer but a bit shorter and less abstract. It does not cover the point of this answer or this comment, which is that JavaScript makes it difficult to plug the current value of a loop variable into your inner function: The \"plugging in\" step can only be done with a helper function that encloses your inner function and is invoked on each loop iteration. (Strictly speaking, the inner function accesses the helper function\\'s copy of the variable, rather than having anything plugged in.) Again, very useful when creating closures, but not part of what a closure is or how it works. There is additional confusion due to closures working differently in functional languages like ML, where variables are bound to values rather than to storage space, providing a constant stream of people who understand closures in a way (namely the \"plugging in\" way) that is simply incorrect for JavaScript, where variables are always bound to storage space, and never to values. another answerthe accepted answerthis answerthis answerthis comment** Any outer function, if several are nested, or even in the global context, as this answer points out clearly.this answer',\n",

And every time the function exits the variable is lost and the name is forgotten.As you may guess, because the variables are re-created every time the function is called, and nobody else will know them, there must be a secret place where they are stored. It could be called Chamber of Secrets or stack or local scope but it doesn\\'t matter.

So, the LexicalEnvironment of the current User execution stays in memory. All variables of User also are its properties, so they are also carefully kept, not junked as usually.this.saythis.say.[[Scope]]The whole point is to ensure that if the inner function wants to access an outer variable in the future, it is able to do so.To summarize:This is called a closure.',\n",

It can be numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things. You can\\'t touch it, smell it or taste it. You can write it down, speak it and hear it. You could use it to create touch smell and taste using a computer. It can be made useful by a computer using code.CODE: All the writing above is called code. It is written in JavaScript.JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript is a language. Like English or French or Chinese are languages. There are lots of languages that are understood by computers and other electronic processors. For JavaScript to be understood by a computer it needs an interpreter. Imagine if a teacher who only speaks Russian comes to teach your class at school. When the teacher says \"все садятся\", the class would not understand. But luckily you have a Russian pupil in your class who tells everyone this means \"everybody sit down\" - so you all do. The class is like a computer and the Russian pupil is the interpreter. For JavaScript the most common interpreter is called a browser.BROWSER: When you connect to the Internet on a computer, tablet or phone to visit a website, you use a browser. Examples you may know are Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The browser can understand JavaScript and tell the computer what it needs to do. The JavaScript instructions are called functions.FUNCTION: A function in JavaScript is like a factory. It might be a little factory with only one machine inside. Or it might contain many other little factories, each with many machines doing different jobs. In a real life clothes factory you might have reams of cloth and bobbins of thread going in and T-shirts and jeans coming out. Our JavaScript factory only processes data, it can\\'t sew, drill a hole or melt metal. In our JavaScript factory data goes in and data comes out.All this data stuff sounds a bit boring, but it is really very cool; we might have a function that tells a robot what to make for dinner. Let\\'s say I invite you and your friend to my house. You like chicken legs best, I like sausages, your friend always wants what you want and my friend does not eat meat.I haven\\'t got time to go shopping, so the function needs to know what we have in the fridge to make decisions. Each ingredient has a different cooking time and we want everything to be served hot by the robot at the same time. We need to provide the function with the data about what we like, the function could \\'talk\\' to the fridge, and the function could control the robot.A function normally has a name, parentheses and braces. Like this:function cookMeal() {  /*  STUFF INSIDE THE FUNCTION  */  }\\nNote that /*...*/ and // stop code being read by the browser./*...*///NAME: You can call a function just about whatever word you want. The example \"cookMeal\" is typical in joining two words together and giving the second one a capital letter at the beginning - but this is not necessary. It can\\'t have a space in it, and it can\\'t be a number on its own.PARENTHESES: \"Parentheses\" or () are the letter box on the JavaScript function factory\\'s door or a post box in the street for sending packets of information to the factory. Sometimes the postbox might be marked for example cookMeal(you, me, yourFriend, myFriend, fridge, dinnerTime), in which case you know what data you have to give it.()cookMeal(you, me, yourFriend, myFriend, fridge, dinnerTime)BRACES: \"Braces\" which look like this {} are the tinted windows of our factory. From inside the factory you can see out, but from the outside you can\\'t see in.{}THE LONG CODE EXAMPLE ABOVEOur code begins with the word function, so we know that it is one! Then the name of the function sing - that\\'s my own description of what the function is about. Then parentheses (). The parentheses are always there for a function. Sometimes they are empty, and sometimes they have something in. This one has a word in: (person). After this there is a brace like this { . This marks the start of the function sing(). It has a partner which marks the end of sing() like this }(person){}function sing(person) {  /* STUFF INSIDE THE FUNCTION */  }\\nSo this function might have something to do with singing, and might need some data about a person. It has instructions inside to do something with that data.Now, after the function sing(), near the end of the code is the linevar person=\"an old lady\";\\nVARIABLE: The letters var stand for \"variable\". A variable is like an envelope. On the outside this envelope is marked \"person\". On the inside it contains a slip of paper with the information our function needs, some letters and spaces joined together like a piece of string (it\\'s called a string) that make a phrase reading \"an old lady\". Our envelope could contain other kinds of things like numbers (called integers), instructions (called functions), lists (called arrays). Because this variable is written outside of all the braces {}, and because you can see out through the tinted windows when you are inside the braces, this variable can be seen from anywhere in the code. We call this a \\'global variable\\'.{}GLOBAL VARIABLE: person is a global variable, meaning that if you change its value from \"an old lady\" to \"a young man\", the person will keep being a young man until you decide to change it again and that any other function in the code can see that it\\'s a young man. Press the F12 button or look at the Options settings to open the developer console of a browser and type \"person\" to see what this value is. Type person=\"a young man\" to change it and then type \"person\" again to see that it has changed.person=\"a young man\"After this we have the linesing(person);\\nThis line is calling the function, as if it were calling a dog\"Come on sing, Come and get person!\"When the browser has loaded the JavaScript code an reached this line, it will start the function. I put the line at the end to make sure that the browser has all the information it needs to run it.Functions define actions  - the main function is about singing. It contains a variable called firstPart which applies to the singing about the person that applies to each of the verses of the song: \"There was \" + person + \" who swallowed\". If you type firstPart into the console, you won\\'t get an answer because the variable is locked up in a function - the browser can\\'t see inside the tinted windows of the braces.CLOSURES: The closures are the smaller functions that are inside the big sing() function. The little factories inside the big factory. They each have their own braces which mean that the variables inside them can\\'t be seen from the outside. That\\'s why the names of the variables (creature and result) can be repeated in the closures but with different values. If you type these variable names in the console window, you won\\'t get its value because it\\'s hidden by two layers of tinted windows.The closures all know what the sing() function\\'s variable called firstPart is, because they can see out from their tinted windows.After the closures come the linesfly();\\nspider();\\nbird();\\ncat();\\nThe sing() function will call each of these functions in the order they are given. Then the sing() function\\'s work will be done.',\n",

              "   'A function in JavaScript is not just a reference to a set of instructions (as in C language), but it also includes a hidden data structure which is composed of references to all nonlocal variables it uses (captured variables). Such two-piece functions are called closures. Every function in JavaScript can be considered a closure.Closures are functions with a state. It is somewhat similar to \"this\" in the sense that \"this\" also provides state for a function but function and \"this\" are separate objects (\"this\" is just a fancy parameter, and the only way to bind it permanently to a function is to create a closure). While \"this\" and function always live separately, a function cannot be separated from its closure and the language provides no means to access captured variables.Because all these external variables referenced by a lexically nested function are actually local variables in the chain of its lexically enclosing functions (global variables can be assumed to be local variables of some root function), and every single execution of a function creates new instances of its local variables, it follows that every execution of a function returning (or otherwise transferring it out, such as registering it as a callback) a nested function creates a new closure (with its own potentially unique set of referenced nonlocal variables which represent its execution context).Also, it must be understood that local variables in JavaScript are created not on the stack frame, but on the heap and destroyed only when no one is referencing them. When a function returns, references to its local variables are decremented, but they can still be non-null if during the current execution they became part of a closure and are still referenced by its lexically nested functions (which can happen only if the references to these nested functions were returned or otherwise transferred to some external code).An example:function foo (initValue) {\\n   //This variable is not destroyed when the foo function exits.\\n   //It is \\'captured\\' by the two nested functions returned below.\\n   var value = initValue;\\n\\n   //Note that the two returned functions are created right now.\\n   //If the foo function is called again, it will return\\n   //new functions referencing a different \\'value\\' variable.\\n   return {\\n       getValue: function () { return value; },\\n       setValue: function (newValue) { value = newValue; }\\n   }\\n}\\n\\nfunction bar () {\\n    //foo sets its local variable \\'value\\' to 5 and returns an object with\\n    //two functions still referencing that local variable\\n    var obj = foo(5);\\n\\n    //Extracting functions just to show that no \\'this\\' is involved here\\n    var getValue = obj.getValue;\\n    var setValue = obj.setValue;\\n\\n    alert(getValue()); //Displays 5\\n    setValue(10);\\n    alert(getValue()); //Displays 10\\n\\n    //At this point getValue and setValue functions are destroyed\\n    //(in reality they are destroyed at the next iteration of the garbage collector).\\n    //The local variable \\'value\\' in the foo is no longer referenced by\\n    //anything and is destroyed too.\\n}\\n\\nbar();\\n',\n",

One kind of data you can return from a function is another function. When that new function gets returned, all the variables and arguments used in the function that created it don\\'t go away. Instead, that parent function \"closes.\" In other words, nothing can look inside of it and see the variables it used except for the function it returned.

The easiest way to create a closure is with a function within a function; the reason being that in JavaScript a function always has access to its containing function’s scope.function outerFunction() {\\r\\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\\r\\n    \\r\\n    function innerFunction() {\\r\\n        alert(outerVar);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    \\r\\n    innerFunction();\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nouterFunction();ALERT: monkeyIn the above example, outerFunction is called which in turn calls innerFunction. Note how outerVar is available to innerFunction, evidenced by its correctly alerting the value of outerVar.Now consider the following:function outerFunction() {\\r\\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\\r\\n    \\r\\n    function innerFunction() {\\r\\n        return outerVar;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    \\r\\n    return innerFunction;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvar referenceToInnerFunction = outerFunction();\\r\\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());ALERT: monkeyreferenceToInnerFunction is set to outerFunction(), which simply returns a reference to innerFunction. When referenceToInnerFunction is called, it returns outerVar. Again, as above, this demonstrates that innerFunction has access to outerVar, a variable of outerFunction. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that it retains this access even after outerFunction has finished executing.And here is where things get really interesting. If we were to get rid of outerFunction, say set it to null, you might think that referenceToInnerFunction would loose its access to the value of outerVar. But this is not the case. function outerFunction() {\\r\\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\\r\\n    \\r\\n    function innerFunction() {\\r\\n        return outerVar;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    \\r\\n    return innerFunction;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvar referenceToInnerFunction = outerFunction();\\r\\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());\\r\\n\\r\\nouterFunction = null;\\r\\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());ALERT: monkey\\nALERT: monkeyBut how is this so? How can referenceToInnerFunction still know the value of outerVar now that outerFunction has been set to null?The reason that referenceToInnerFunction can still access the value of outerVar is because when the closure was first created by placing innerFunction inside of outerFunction, innerFunction added a reference to outerFunction’s scope (its variables and functions) to its scope chain. What this means is that innerFunction has a pointer or reference to all of outerFunction’s variables, including outerVar. So even when outerFunction has finished executing, or even if it is deleted or set to null, the variables in its scope, like outerVar, stick around in memory because of the outstanding reference to them on the part of the innerFunction that has been returned to referenceToInnerFunction. To truly release outerVar and the rest of outerFunction’s variables from memory you would have to get rid of this outstanding reference to them, say by setting referenceToInnerFunction to null as well.//////////Two other things about closures to note. First, the closure will always have access to the last values of its containing function.function outerFunction() {\\r\\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\\r\\n    \\r\\n    function innerFunction() {\\r\\n        alert(outerVar);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    \\r\\n    outerVar = \"gorilla\";\\r\\n\\r\\n    innerFunction();\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nouterFunction();ALERT: gorillaSecond, when a closure is created, it retains a reference to all of its enclosing function’s variables and functions; it doesn’t get to pick and choose. And but so, closures should be used sparingly, or at least carefully, as they can be memory intensive; a lot of variables can be kept in memory long after a containing function has finished executing.',\n",

What my solution here does is NOT replace irreversibly the files you have in your working directory with files hauled up/extracted from the depths of the git repository lurking beneath your .git/ directory using fiendishly clever and diabolically powerful git commands, of which there are many. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO SUCH DEEP-SEA DIVING TO RECOVER what may appear to be a disastrous situation, and attempting to do so without sufficient expertise may prove fatal.Copy the whole directory and call it something else, like \"my project - copy\". Assuming your git repository (\"repo\") files are under the \"my project\" directory (the default place for them, under a directory called \".git\"), you will now have copied both your work files and your repo files.Do this in the directory \"my project\": .../my project $ git reset --hard [first-4-letters&numbers-of-commit\\'s-SHA]\\nThis will return the state of the repo under \"my project\" to what it was when you made that commit (a \"commit\" means a snapshot of your working files). All commits since the \"resetted\" commit will be lost forever under \"my project\", BUT... they will still be present in the repo under \"my project - copy\" since you copied all those files - including the ones in the repo, under .../.git/.resetYou then have two versions on your system... you can examine or copy or modify files of interest, or whatever, from the previous commit. You can completely discard the files under \"my project - copy\", if you have decided the new work since the restored commit was going nowhere...The obvious thing if you want to carry on with the state of the project without actually discarding the work since this retrieved commit is to rename your directory again: Delete the project containing the retrieved commit (or give it a temporary name) and rename your \"my project - copy\" directory back to \"my project\". Then maybe try to understand some of the other answers here, and probably do another commit fairly soon.Git is a brilliant creation but absolutely no-one is able to just \"pick it up on the fly\": also people who try to explain it far too often assume prior knowledge of other VCS [Version Control Systems] and delve far too deep far too soon, and commit other terrible crimes, like using interchangeable terms for \"checking out\" - in ways which sometimes appear almost calculated to confuse a beginner.To save yourself much stress, learn from my scars. You have to pretty much have to read a book on Git - I\\'d recommend reading THE BOOK, Pro Git 2nd edition: available for free download etc. from git central. Published 2014 but, as at early 2022, still the best. Do it sooner rather than later: Git is destined to be part of your life from now on. If you do, bear in mind that much of the complexity of Git comes from branching and then remerging: the Pro Git book actually introduces this central aspect very gently, but you can skip those parts in any book on your first read. From your question there\\'s no reason why people should be blinding you with science.from git centralEspecially if, for example, this is a desperate situation and you\\'re a newbie with Git!PS: (slight caution) One other thought: It is (now) actually quite simple to keep the Git repo in a directory other than the one with the working files. This would mean you would not copy the entire Git repository using the above quick & dirty solution. See the answer by Fryer using --separate-git-dir here. Bearing that in mind, be warned: If you have a \"separate-directory\" repository which you don\\'t copy, and you do a hard reset, all versions subsequent to the reset commit really will be lost forever forever, unless you have, as you absolutely should, regularly backed up your repository, preferably to the Cloud (e.g. Google Drive) among other places.--separate-git-dirhereGoogle DriveOn this subject of \"backing up to the Cloud\", the next step is to open an account (free of course) with GitHub or (better in my view) GitLab. You can then regularly do a git push command to make your Cloud repo up-to-date \"properly\". But again, talking about this may be too much too soon: git push has to be configured, can fail to work for a totally baffling technical reason, involves learning about remote repos (\"origin\", etc). So a quick-and-dirty Cloud-based backup approach may be preferable until you become knowledgeable.

This is a function declaration:function abc(){}\\nabc here is defined everywhere in the current scope:abc// We can call it here\\nabc(); // Works\\n\\n// Yet, it is defined down there.\\nfunction abc(){}\\n\\n// We can call it again\\nabc(); // Works\\nAlso, it hoisted through a return statement:return// We can call it here\\nabc(); // Works\\nreturn;\\nfunction abc(){}\\nThis is a function expression:var xyz = function(){};\\nxyz here is defined from the point of assignment:xyz// We can\\'t call it here\\nxyz(); // UNDEFINED!!!\\n\\n// Now it is defined\\nxyz = function(){}\\n\\n// We can call it here\\nxyz(); // works\\nFunction declaration vs. function expression is the real reason why there is a difference demonstrated by Greg.Fun fact:var xyz = function abc(){};\\nconsole.log(xyz.name); // Prints \"abc\"\\nPersonally, I prefer the \"function expression\" declaration because this way I can control the visibility. When I define the function likevar abc = function(){};\\nI know that I defined the function locally. When I define the function likeabc = function(){};\\nI know that I defined it globally providing that I didn\\'t define abc anywhere in the chain of scopes. This style of definition is resilient even when used inside eval(). While the definitionabceval()function abc(){};\\ndepends on the context and may leave you guessing where it is actually defined, especially in the case of eval() — the answer is: It depends on the browser.eval()',\n",
              "   'Here\\'s the rundown on the standard forms that create functions: (Originally written for another question, but adapted after being moved into the canonical question.)Terms:ECMAScript 5th editionECMAScript 2015The quick list:Function Declaration\"Anonymous\" function Expression (which despite the term, sometimes create functions with names)functionNamed function ExpressionfunctionAccessor Function Initializer (ES5+)Arrow Function Expression (ES2015+) (which, like anonymous function expressions, don\\'t involve an explicit name, and yet can create functions with names)Method Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)Constructor and Method Declarations in class (ES2015+)classThe first form is a function declaration, which looks like this:function x() {\\n    console.log(\\'x\\');\\n}\\nA function declaration is a declaration; it\\'s not a statement or expression. As such, you don\\'t follow it with a ; (although doing so is harmless).;A function declaration is processed when execution enters the context in which it appears, before any step-by-step code is executed. The function it creates is given a proper name (x in the example above), and that name is put in the scope in which the declaration appears.xBecause it\\'s processed before any step-by-step code in the same context, you can do things like this:x(); // Works even though it\\'s above the declaration\\nfunction x() {\\n    console.log(\\'x\\');\\n}\\nUntil ES2015, the spec didn\\'t cover what a JavaScript engine should do if you put a function declaration inside a control structure like try, if, switch, while, etc., like this:tryifswitchwhileif (someCondition) {\\n    function foo() {    // <===== HERE THERE\\n    }                   // <===== BE DRAGONS\\n}\\nAnd since they\\'re processed before step-by-step code is run, it\\'s tricky to know what to do when they\\'re in a control structure.Although doing this wasn\\'t specified until ES2015, it was an allowable extension to support function declarations in blocks. Unfortunately (and inevitably), different engines did different things.As of ES2015, the specification says what to do. In fact, it gives three separate things to do:The rules for the loose modes are tricky, but in strict mode, function declarations in blocks are easy: They\\'re local to the block (they have block scope, which is also new in ES2015), and they\\'re hoisted to the top of the block. So:\"use strict\";\\nif (someCondition) {\\n    foo();               // Works just fine\\n    function foo() {\\n    }\\n}\\nconsole.log(typeof foo); // \"undefined\" (`foo` is not in scope here\\n                         // because it\\'s not in the same block)\\nfunctionThe second common form is called an anonymous function expression:var y = function () {\\n    console.log(\\'y\\');\\n};\\nLike all expressions, it\\'s evaluated when it\\'s reached in the step-by-step execution of the code.In ES5, the function this creates has no name (it\\'s anonymous). In ES2015, the function is assigned a name if possible by inferring it from context. In the example above, the name would be y. Something similar is done when the function is the value of a property initializer. (For details on when this happens and the rules, search for SetFunctionName in the the specification\\xa0— it appears all over the place.)ySetFunctionNamethe specificationfunctionThe third form is a named function expression (\"NFE\"):var z = function w() {\\n    console.log(\\'zw\\')\\n};\\nThe function this creates has a proper name (w in this case). Like all expressions, this is evaluated when it\\'s reached in the step-by-step execution of the code. The name of the function is not added to the scope in which the expression appears; the name is in scope within the function itself:wvar z = function w() {\\n    console.log(typeof w); // \"function\"\\n};\\nconsole.log(typeof w);     // \"undefined\"\\nNote that NFEs have frequently been a source of bugs for JavaScript implementations. IE8 and earlier, for instance, handle NFEs completely incorrectly, creating two different functions at two different times. Early versions of Safari had issues as well. The good news is that current versions of browsers (IE9 and up, current Safari) don\\'t have those issues any more. (But as of this writing, sadly, IE8 remains in widespread use, and so using NFEs with code for the web in general is still problematic.)completely incorrectlySometimes functions can sneak in largely unnoticed; that\\'s the case with accessor functions. Here\\'s an example:var obj = {\\n    value: 0,\\n    get f() {\\n        return this.value;\\n    },\\n    set f(v) {\\n        this.value = v;\\n    }\\n};\\nconsole.log(obj.f);         // 0\\nconsole.log(typeof obj.f);  // \"number\"\\nNote that when I used the function, I didn\\'t use ()! That\\'s because it\\'s an accessor function for a property. We get and set the property in the normal way, but behind the scenes, the function is called.()You can also create accessor functions with Object.defineProperty, Object.defineProperties, and the lesser-known second argument to Object.create.Object.definePropertyObject.definePropertiesObject.createES2015 brings us the arrow function. Here\\'s one example:var a = [1, 2, 3];\\nvar b = a.map(n => n * 2);\\nconsole.log(b.join(\", \")); // 2, 4, 6\\nSee that n => n * 2 thing hiding in the map() call? That\\'s a function.n => n * 2map()A couple of things about arrow functions:They don\\'t have their own this. Instead, they close over the this of the context where they\\'re defined. (They also close over arguments and, where relevant, super.) This means that the this within them is the same as the this where they\\'re created, and cannot be changed.thisthisargumentssuperthisthisAs you\\'ll have noticed with the above, you don\\'t use the keyword function; instead, you use =>.function=>The n => n * 2 example above is one form of them. If you have multiple arguments to pass the function, you use parens:n => n * 2var a = [1, 2, 3];\\nvar b = a.map((n, i) => n * i);\\nconsole.log(b.join(\", \")); // 0, 2, 6\\n(Remember that Array#map passes the entry as the first argument, and the index as the second.)Array#mapIn both cases, the body of the function is just an expression; the function\\'s return value will automatically be the result of that expression (you don\\'t use an explicit return).returnIf you\\'re doing more than just a single expression, use {} and an explicit return (if you need to return a value), as normal:{}returnvar a = [\\n  {first: \"Joe\", last: \"Bloggs\"},\\n  {first: \"Albert\", last: \"Bloggs\"},\\n  {first: \"Mary\", last: \"Albright\"}\\n];\\na = a.sort((a, b) => {\\n  var rv = a.last.localeCompare(b.last);\\n  if (rv === 0) {\\n    rv = a.first.localeCompare(b.first);\\n  }\\n  return rv;\\n});\\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(a));\\nThe version without { ... } is called an arrow function with an expression body or concise body. (Also: A concise arrow function.) The one with { ... } defining the body is an arrow function with a function body. (Also: A verbose arrow function.){ ... }{ ... }ES2015 allows a shorter form of declaring a property that references a function called a method definition; it looks like this:var o = {\\n    foo() {\\n    }\\n};\\nthe almost-equivalent in ES5 and earlier would be:var o = {\\n    foo: function foo() {\\n    }\\n};\\nthe difference (other than verbosity) is that a method can use super, but a function cannot. So for instance, if you had an object that defined (say) valueOf using method syntax, it could use super.valueOf() to get the value Object.prototype.valueOf would have returned (before presumably doing something else with it), whereas the ES5 version would have to do Object.prototype.valueOf.call(this) instead.supervalueOfsuper.valueOf()Object.prototype.valueOfObject.prototype.valueOf.call(this)That also means that the method has a reference to the object it was defined on, so if that object is temporary (for instance, you\\'re passing it into Object.assign as one of the source objects), method syntax could mean that the object is retained in memory when otherwise it could have been garbage collected (if the JavaScript engine doesn\\'t detect that situation and handle it if none of the methods uses super).Object.assignsuperclassES2015 brings us class syntax, including declared constructors and methods:classclass Person {\\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\\n        this.firstName = firstName;\\n        this.lastName = lastName;\\n    }\\n\\n    getFullName() {\\n        return this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName;\\n    }\\n}\\nThere are two function declarations above: One for the constructor, which gets the name Person, and one for getFullName, which is a function assigned to Person.prototype.PersongetFullNamePerson.prototype',\n",

This means that we cannot assign a new value to the variable. Please note, however, that this does not make the contents of the variable immutable: if you do const arr = [], then you can still do arr[10] = \"example\". Only doing something like arr = \"new value\" or arr = [] would throw an error as seen below.const arr = []arr[10] = \"example\"arr = \"new value\"arr = [](function(){\\n    \"use strict\";\\n    const foobar = function(){}; // initial value\\n    try {\\n        foobar = \"Hello World!\"; // new value\\n        console.log(\"[no error]\");\\n    } catch(error) {\\n        console.log(\"ERROR: \" + error.message);\\n    }\\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\\n})();Interestingly, if we declare the variable as function funcName(){}, then the immutability of the variable is the same as declaring it with var.function funcName(){}var(function(){\\n    \"use strict\";\\n    function foobar(){}; // initial value\\n    try {\\n        foobar = \"Hello World!\"; // new value\\n        console.log(\"[no error]\");\\n    } catch(error) {\\n        console.log(\"ERROR: \" + error.message);\\n    }\\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\\n})();The \"nearest block\" is the nearest \"function,\" (including asynchronous functions, generator functions, and asynchronous generator functions). However, interestingly, a function functionName() {} behaves like a var functionName = function() {} when in a non-closure block to items outside said closure.

              "   'A function declaration and a function expression assigned to a variable behave the same once the binding is established.There is a difference however at how and when the function object is actually associated with its variable. This difference is due to the mechanism called variable hoisting in JavaScript.Basically, all function declarations and variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the function in which the declaration occurs (this is why we say that JavaScript has function scope).When a function declaration is hoisted, the function body \"follows\"\\nso when the function body is evaluated, the variable will immediately\\nbe bound to a function object.When a variable declaration is hoisted, the initialization does not\\nfollow, but is \"left behind\". The variable is initialized to\\nundefined at the start of the function body, and will be assigned\\na value at its original location in the code. (Actually, it will be assigned a value at every location where a declaration of a variable with the same name occurs.)undefinedThe order of hoisting is also important: function declarations take precedence over variable declarations with the same name, and the last function declaration takes precedence over previous function declarations with the same name.Some examples...var foo = 1;\\nfunction bar() {\\n  if (!foo) {\\n    var foo = 10 }\\n  return foo; }\\nbar() // 10\\nVariable foo is hoisted to the top of the function, initialized to undefined, so that !foo is true, so foo is assigned 10. The foo outside of bar\\'s scope plays no role and is untouched. fooundefined!footruefoo10foobarfunction f() {\\n  return a; \\n  function a() {return 1}; \\n  var a = 4;\\n  function a() {return 2}}\\nf()() // 2\\n\\nfunction f() {\\n  return a;\\n  var a = 4;\\n  function a() {return 1};\\n  function a() {return 2}}\\nf()() // 2\\nFunction declarations take precedence over variable declarations, and the last function declaration \"sticks\".function f() {\\n  var a = 4;\\n  function a() {return 1}; \\n  function a() {return 2}; \\n  return a; }\\nf() // 4\\nIn this example a is initialized with the function object resulting from evaluating the second function declaration, and then is assigned 4.a4var a = 1;\\nfunction b() {\\n  a = 10;\\n  return;\\n  function a() {}}\\nb();\\na // 1\\nHere the function declaration is hoisted first, declaring and initializing variable a.

Sometimes I have to add new functions to do new branding-specific things. I am happy to change the shared coded, but I don't want to have to change all 160 sets of branding files.By using the variable syntax, I can declare the variable (a function pointer essentially) in the shared code and either assign a trivial stub function, or set to null.The one or two brandings that need a specific implementation of the function can then define their version of the function and assign this to the variable if they want, and the rest do nothing. I can test for a null function before I execute it in the shared code.From people's comments above, I gather it may be possible to redefine a static function too, but I think the variable solution is nice and clear.\",\n",

On the other hand, it\\'s genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language-neutral way.

Depending on members of the current type, the current namespace and the applied using directives and their placement, String could be a value or a type distinct from global::System.String.stringStringusingStringglobal::System.StringI shall provide two examples where using directives will not help.usingFirst, when String is a value of the current type (or a local variable):Stringclass MySequence<TElement>\\n{\\n  public IEnumerable<TElement> String { get; set; }\\n\\n  void Example()\\n  {\\n    var test = String.Format(\"Hello {0}.\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek);\\n  }\\n}\\nThe above will not compile because IEnumerable<> does not have a non-static member called Format, and no extension methods apply. In the above case, it may still be possible to use String in other contexts where a type is the only possibility syntactically. For example String local = \"Hi mum!\"; could be OK (depending on namespace and using directives).IEnumerable<>FormatStringString local = \"Hi mum!\";usingWorse: Saying String.Concat(someSequence) will likely (depending on usings) go to the Linq extension method Enumerable.Concat. It will not go to the static method string.Concat.String.Concat(someSequence)usingEnumerable.Concatstring.ConcatSecondly, when String is another type, nested inside the current type:Stringclass MyPiano\\n{\\n  protected class String\\n  {\\n  }\\n\\n  void Example()\\n  {\\n    var test1 = String.Format(\"Hello {0}.\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek);\\n    String test2 = \"Goodbye\";\\n  }\\n}\\nNeither statement in the Example method compiles.

In fact, I wish that\\n  compilers didn’t even offer the primitive type names and forced developers to use the FCL\\n  type names instead. Here are my reasons:I’ve seen a number of developers confused, not knowing whether to use string\\n  or String in their code. Because in C# string (a keyword) maps exactly to\\n  System.String (an FCL type), there is no difference and either can be used. Similarly,\\n  I’ve heard some developers say that int represents a 32-bit integer when the application\\n  is running on a 32-bit OS and that it represents a 64-bit integer when the application\\n  is running on a 64-bit OS. This statement is absolutely false: in C#, an int always maps\\n  to System.Int32, and therefore it represents a 32-bit integer regardless of the OS the\\n  code is running on. If programmers would use Int32 in their code, then this potential\\n  confusion is also eliminated.In C#, long maps to System.Int64, but in a different programming language, long\\n  could map to an Int16 or Int32. In fact, C++/CLI does treat long as an Int32.\\n  Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code’s\\n  intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language.\\n  In fact, most languages won’t even treat long as a keyword and won’t compile code\\n  that uses it.The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For\\n  example, the BinaryReader type offers methods such as ReadBoolean, ReadInt32,\\n  ReadSingle, and so on, and the System.Convert type offers methods such as\\n  ToBoolean, ToInt32, ToSingle, and so on. Although it’s legal to write the following\\n  code, the line with float feels very unnatural to me, and it’s not obvious that the line is\\n  correct:BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(...);\\nfloat val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK, but feels unnatural\\nSingle val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK and feels good\\nMany programmers that use C# exclusively tend to forget that other programming\\n  languages can be used against the CLR, and because of this, C#-isms creep into the\\n  class library code. For example, Microsoft’s FCL is almost exclusively written in C# and\\n  developers on the FCL team have now introduced methods into the library such as\\n  Array’s GetLongLength, which returns an Int64 value that is a long in C# but not\\n  in other languages (like C++/CLI).

Hence string has a precise, unambiguous meaning in C# code.stringSystem.StringstringThe identifier String though has no concrete meaning in C#. It is an identifier that goes through all the name lookup rules as Widget, Student, etc … It could bind to string or it could bind to a type in another assembly entirely whose purposes may be entirely different than string.

To remove an element from an array, use Array#splice or Array#pop. For example:Array#spliceArray#poparr;             // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\narr.splice(3,1); // 3\\narr;             // [0, 1, 2, 4]\\nStrictly speaking, it\\'s impossible to truly delete anything in JavaScript. The delete operator neither deletes objects nor frees memory. Rather, it sets its operand to undefined and manipulates the parent object so that the member is gone.deleteundefinedlet parent = {\\n    member: { str: \"Hello\" }\\n};\\nlet secondref = parent.member;\\n\\ndelete parent.member;\\nparent.member;        // undefined\\nsecondref;            // { str: \"Hello\" }\\nThe object is not deleted. Only the reference is. Memory is only freed\\nby the garbage collector when all references to an object are removed.Another important caveat is that the delete operator will not reorganize structures for you, which has results that can seem counterintuitive. Deleting an array index, for example, will leave a \"hole\" in it.deletelet array = [0, 1, 2, 3]; // [0, 1, 2, 3]\\ndelete array[2];          // [0, 1, empty, 3]\\nThis is because arrays are objects.

Arrays have a dedicated methods for removing elements and reallocating memory: Array#splice() and Array#pop.deleteArray#splice()Array#popArray#splice mutates the array, and returns any removed indices. deleteCount elements are removed from index start, and item1, item2... itemN are inserted into the array from index start. If deleteCount is omitted then elements from startIndex are removed to the end of the array.Array#splicedeleteCountstartitem1, item2... itemNstartdeleteCountlet a = [0,1,2,3,4]\\na.splice(2,2) // returns the removed elements [2,3]\\n// ...and `a` is now [0,1,4]\\nThere is also a similarly named, but different, function on Array.prototype: Array#slice.Array.prototypeArray#sliceArray#slice is non-destructive, and returns a new array containing the indicated indices from start to end. If end is left unspecified, it defaults to the end of the array. If end is positive, it specifies the zero-based non-inclusive index to stop at. If end is negative it, it specifies the index to stop at by counting back from the end of the array (eg. -1 will omit the final index). If end <= start, the result is an empty array.Array#slicestartendendendendend <= startlet a = [0,1,2,3,4]\\nlet slices = [\\n    a.slice(0,2),\\n    a.slice(2,2),\\n    a.slice(2,3),\\n    a.slice(2,5) ]\\n\\n//   a           [0,1,2,3,4]\\n//   slices[0]   [0 1]- - -   \\n//   slices[1]    - - - - -\\n//   slices[2]    - -[3]- -\\n//   slices[3]    - -[2 4 5]\\nArray#pop removes the last element from an array, and returns that element.

The one is to remove it for whole the memory and the list of object keys or the other is just to remove it from your object. As it has been mentioned in some other answers, the delete keyword is the main part. Let\\'s say you have your object like:deletemyJSONObject = {\"ircEvent\": \"PRIVMSG\", \"method\": \"newURI\", \"regex\": \"^http://.*\"};\\nIf you do:console.log(Object.keys(myJSONObject));\\nthe result would be:[\"ircEvent\", \"method\", \"regex\"]\\nYou can delete that specific key from your object keys like:delete myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\\nThen your objects key using Object.keys(myJSONObject) would be:Object.keys(myJSONObject)[\"ircEvent\", \"method\"]\\nBut the point is if you care about memory and you want to whole the object gets removed from the memory, it is recommended to set it to null before you delete the key:myJSONObject[\"regex\"] = null;\\ndelete myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\\nThe other important point here is to be careful about your other references to the same object. For instance, if you create a variable like:var regex = myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\\nOr add it as a new pointer to another object like:var myOtherObject = {};\\nmyOtherObject[\"regex\"] = myJSONObject[\"regex\"];\\nThen even if you remove it from your object myJSONObject, that specific object won\\'t get deleted from the memory, since the regex variable and myOtherObject[\"regex\"] still have their values. Then how could we remove the object from the memory for sure?myJSONObjectregexmyOtherObject[\"regex\"]The answer would be to delete all the references you have in your code, pointed to that very object and also not use var statements to create new references to that object. This last point regarding var statements, is one of the most crucial issues that we are usually faced with, because using var statements would prevent the created object from getting removed.varvarvarWhich means in this case you won\\'t be able to remove that object because you have created the regex variable via a var statement, and if you do:regexvardelete regex; //False\\nThe result would be false, which means that your delete statement haven\\'t been executed as you expected. But if you had not created that variable before, and you only had myOtherObject[\"regex\"] as your last existing reference, you could have done this just by removing it like:falsemyOtherObject[\"regex\"]myOtherObject[\"regex\"] = null;\\ndelete myOtherObject[\"regex\"];\\nIn other words, a JavaScript object is eligible to be killed as soon as there is no reference left in your code pointed to that object.Update:Thanks to @AgentME:Setting a property to null before deleting it doesn\\'t accomplish\\nanything (unless the object has been sealed by Object.seal and the\\ndelete fails.

An example piece of syntax in this category:\\'use strict\\'\\nconst iLikeMutatingStuffDontI = { myNameIs: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', [Symbol.for(\\'amICool\\')]: true }\\ndelete iLikeMutatingStuffDontI[Symbol.for(\\'amICool\\')] // true\\nObject.defineProperty({ myNameIs: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', \\'amICool\\', { value: true, configurable: false })\\ndelete iLikeMutatingStuffDontI[\\'amICool\\'] // throws\\nThis category is the oldest, most straightforward & most widely supported category of property removal. It supports Symbol & array indexes in addition to strings and works in every version of JavaScript except for the very first release. However, it\\'s mutative which violates some programming principles and has performance implications. It also can result in uncaught exceptions when used on non-configurable properties in strict mode.Symbolnon-configurable properties in strict modeThis category is for operating on plain object or array instances in newer ECMAScript flavors when a non-mutative approach is desired and you don\\'t need to account for Symbol keys:const foo = { name: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', [Symbol.for(\\'isCool\\')]: true }\\nconst { name, ...coolio } = foo // coolio doesn\\'t have \"name\"\\nconst { isCool, ...coolio2 } = foo // coolio2 has everything from `foo` because `isCool` doesn\\'t account for Symbols :(\\nThis category is for operating on object literals or object instances when you want to retain/continue to use the original reference while guarding against exceptions being thrown on unconfigurable properties:\\'use strict\\'\\nconst iLikeMutatingStuffDontI = { myNameIs: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', [Symbol.for(\\'amICool\\')]: true }\\nReflect.deleteProperty(iLikeMutatingStuffDontI, Symbol.for(\\'amICool\\')) // true\\nObject.defineProperty({ myNameIs: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', \\'amICool\\', { value: true, configurable: false })\\nReflect.deleteProperty(iLikeMutatingStuffDontI, \\'amICool\\') // false\\nIn addition, while mutating objects in-place isn\\'t stateless, you can use the functional nature of Reflect.deleteProperty to do partial application and other functional techniques that aren\\'t possible with delete statements.Reflect.deletePropertydeleteThis category is for operating on plain object or array instances in newer ECMAScript flavors when a non-mutative approach is desired and you don\\'t need to account for Symbol keys:const foo = { name: \\'KIDDDDD!\\', [Symbol.for(\\'isCool\\')]: true }\\nconst { name, ...coolio } = foo // coolio doesn\\'t have \"name\"\\nconst { isCool, ...coolio2 } = foo // coolio2 has everything from `foo` because `isCool` doesn\\'t account for Symbols :(\\nThis category is generally allows for greater functional flexibility, including accounting for Symbols & omitting more than one property in one statement:const o = require(\"lodash.omit\")\\nconst foo = { [Symbol.for(\\'a\\')]: \\'abc\\', b: \\'b\\', c: \\'c\\' }\\nconst bar = o(foo, \\'a\\') // \"\\'a\\' undefined\"\\nconst baz = o(foo, [ Symbol.for(\\'a\\'), \\'b\\' ]) // Symbol supported, more than one prop at a time, \"Symbol.for(\\'a\\') undefined\"\\n',\n",

Thus, the following instructionclass>>> class ObjectCreator(object):\\n...       pass\\n...creates an object with the name ObjectCreator!ObjectCreatorThis object (the class) is itself capable of creating objects (called instances).But still, it\\'s an object. Therefore, like all objects:JustAnotherVariable = ObjectCreator\\nObjectCreator.class_attribute = \\'foo\\'\\nprint(ObjectCreator)\\n1 Note that merely assigning it to another variable doesn\\'t change the class\\'s __name__, i.e.,__name__>>> print(JustAnotherVariable)\\n<class \\'__main__.ObjectCreator\\'>\\n\\n>>> print(JustAnotherVariable())\\n<__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8997b4c>\\nSince classes are objects, you can create them on the fly, like any object.First, you can create a class in a function using class:class>>> def choose_class(name):\\n...     if name == \\'foo\\':\\n...         class Foo(object):\\n...             pass\\n...         return Foo # return the class, not an instance\\n...     else:\\n...         class Bar(object):\\n...             pass\\n...         return Bar\\n...\\n>>> MyClass = choose_class(\\'foo\\')\\n>>> print(MyClass) # the function returns a class, not an instance\\n<class \\'__main__.Foo\\'>\\n>>> print(MyClass()) # you can create an object from this class\\n<__main__.Foo object at 0x89c6d4c>\\nBut it\\'s not so dynamic, since you still have to write the whole class yourself.Since classes are objects, they must be generated by something.When you use the class keyword, Python creates this object automatically. But as\\nwith most things in Python, it gives you a way to do it manually.classRemember the function type? The good old function that lets you know what\\ntype an object is:type>>> print(type(1))\\n<type \\'int\\'>\\n>>> print(type(\"1\"))\\n<type \\'str\\'>\\n>>> print(type(ObjectCreator))\\n<type \\'type\\'>\\n>>> print(type(ObjectCreator()))\\n<class \\'__main__.ObjectCreator\\'>\\nWell, type has also a completely different ability: it can create classes on the fly. type can take the description of a class as parameters,\\nand return a class.typetypetype(I  know, it\\'s silly that the same function can have two completely different uses according to the parameters you pass to it. It\\'s an issue due to backward\\ncompatibility in Python)type works this way:typetype(name, bases, attrs)\\nWhere:namebasesattrse.g.:>>> class MyShinyClass(object):\\n...       pass\\ncan be created manually this way:>>> MyShinyClass = type(\\'MyShinyClass\\', (), {}) # returns a class object\\n>>> print(MyShinyClass)\\n<class \\'__main__.MyShinyClass\\'>\\n>>> print(MyShinyClass()) # create an instance with the class\\n<__main__.MyShinyClass object at 0x8997cec>\\nYou\\'ll notice that we use MyShinyClass as the name of the class\\nand as the variable to hold the class reference. They can be different,\\nbut there is no reason to complicate things.MyShinyClasstype accepts a dictionary to define the attributes of the class. So:type>>> class Foo(object):\\n...       bar = True\\nCan be translated to:>>> Foo = type(\\'Foo\\', (), {\\'bar\\':True})\\nAnd used as a normal class:>>> print(Foo)\\n<class \\'__main__.Foo\\'>\\n>>> print(Foo.bar)\\nTrue\\n>>> f = Foo()\\n>>> print(f)\\n<__main__.Foo object at 0x8a9b84c>\\n>>> print(f.bar)\\nTrue\\nAnd of course, you can inherit from it, so:>>>   class FooChild(Foo):\\n...         pass\\nwould be:>>> FooChild = type(\\'FooChild\\', (Foo,), {})\\n>>> print(FooChild)\\n<class \\'__main__.FooChild\\'>\\n>>> print(FooChild.bar) # bar is inherited from Foo\\nTrue\\nEventually, you\\'ll want to add methods to your class. Just define a function\\nwith the proper signature and assign it as an attribute.>>> def echo_bar(self):\\n...       print(self.bar)\\n...\\n>>> FooChild = type(\\'FooChild\\', (Foo,), {\\'echo_bar\\': echo_bar})\\n>>> hasattr(Foo, \\'echo_bar\\')\\nFalse\\n>>> hasattr(FooChild, \\'echo_bar\\')\\nTrue\\n>>> my_foo = FooChild()\\n>>> my_foo.echo_bar()\\nTrue\\nAnd you can add even more methods after you dynamically create the class, just like adding methods to a normally created class object.>>> def echo_bar_more(self):\\n...       print(\\'yet another method\\')\\n...\\n>>> FooChild.echo_bar_more = echo_bar_more\\n>>> hasattr(FooChild, \\'echo_bar_more\\')\\nTrue\\nYou see where we are going: in Python, classes are objects, and you can create a class on the fly, dynamically.This is what Python does when you use the keyword class, and it does so by using a metaclass.classMetaclasses are the \\'stuff\\' that creates classes.You define classes in order to create objects, right?But we learned that Python classes are objects.Well, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes\\' classes,\\nyou can picture them this way:MyClass = MetaClass()\\nmy_object = MyClass()\\nYou\\'ve seen that type lets you do something like this:typeMyClass = type(\\'MyClass\\', (), {})\\nIt\\'s because the function type is in fact a metaclass. type is the\\nmetaclass Python uses to create all classes behind the scenes.typetypeNow you wonder \"why the heck is it written in lowercase, and not Type?\"TypeWell, I guess it\\'s a matter of consistency with str, the class that creates\\nstrings objects, and int the class that creates integer objects. type is\\njust the class that creates class objects.strinttypeYou see that by checking the __class__ attribute.__class__Everything, and I mean everything, is an object in Python. That includes integers,\\nstrings, functions and classes. All of them are objects. And all of them have\\nbeen created from a class:>>> age = 35\\n>>> age.__class__\\n<type \\'int\\'>\\n>>> name = \\'bob\\'\\n>>> name.__class__\\n<type \\'str\\'>\\n>>> def foo(): pass\\n>>> foo.__class__\\n<type \\'function\\'>\\n>>> class Bar(object): pass\\n>>> b = Bar()\\n>>> b.__class__\\n<class \\'__main__.Bar\\'>\\nNow, what is the __class__ of any __class__ ?__class____class__>>> age.__class__.__class__\\n<type \\'type\\'>\\n>>> name.__class__.__class__\\n<type \\'type\\'>\\n>>> foo.__class__.__class__\\n<type \\'type\\'>\\n>>> b.__class__.__class__\\n<type \\'type\\'>\\nSo, a metaclass is just the stuff that creates class objects.You can call it a \\'class factory\\' if you wish.type is the built-in metaclass Python uses, but of course, you can create your\\nown metaclass.type__metaclass____metaclass__In Python 2, you can add a __metaclass__ attribute when you write a class (see next section for the Python 3 syntax):__metaclass__class Foo(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = something...\\n    [...]\\nIf you do so, Python will use the metaclass to create the class Foo.FooCareful, it\\'s tricky.You write class Foo(object) first, but the class object Foo is not created\\nin memory yet.class Foo(object)FooPython will look for __metaclass__ in the class definition. If it finds it,\\nit will use it to create the object class Foo. If it doesn\\'t, it will use\\ntype to create the class.__metaclass__FootypeRead that several times.When you do:class Foo(Bar):\\n    pass\\nPython does the following:Is there a __metaclass__ attribute in Foo?__metaclass__FooIf yes, create in-memory a class object (I said a class object, stay with me here), with the name Foo by using what is in __metaclass__.Foo__metaclass__If Python can\\'t find __metaclass__, it will look for a __metaclass__ at the MODULE level, and try to do the same (but only for classes that don\\'t inherit anything, basically old-style classes).__metaclass____metaclass__Then if it can\\'t find any __metaclass__ at all, it will use the Bar\\'s (the first parent) own metaclass (which might be the default type) to create the class object.__metaclass__BartypeBe careful here that the __metaclass__ attribute will not be inherited, the metaclass of the parent (Bar.__class__) will be. If Bar used a __metaclass__ attribute that created Bar with type() (and not type.__new__()), the subclasses will not inherit that behavior.__metaclass__Bar.__class__Bar__metaclass__Bartype()type.__new__()Now the big question is, what can you put in __metaclass__?__metaclass__The answer is something that can create a class.And what can create a class? type, or anything that subclasses or uses it.typeThe syntax to set the metaclass has been changed in Python 3:class Foo(object, metaclass=something):\\n    ...\\ni.e. the __metaclass__ attribute is no longer used, in favor of a keyword argument in the list of base classes.__metaclass__The behavior of metaclasses however stays largely the same.largely the sameOne thing added to metaclasses in Python 3 is that you can also pass attributes as keyword-arguments into a metaclass, like so:class Foo(object, metaclass=something, kwarg1=value1, kwarg2=value2):\\n    ...\\nRead the section below for how Python handles this.The main purpose of a metaclass is to change the class automatically,\\nwhen it\\'s created.You usually do this for APIs, where you want to create classes matching the\\ncurrent context.Imagine a stupid example, where you decide that all classes in your module\\nshould have their attributes written in uppercase. There are several ways to\\ndo this, but one way is to set __metaclass__ at the module level.__metaclass__This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass,\\nand we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.Luckily, __metaclass__ can actually be any callable, it doesn\\'t need to be a\\nformal class (I know, something with \\'class\\' in its name doesn\\'t need to be\\na class, go figure... but it\\'s helpful).__metaclass__So we will start with a simple example, by using a function.# the metaclass will automatically get passed the same argument\\n# that you usually pass to `type`\\ndef upper_attr(future_class_name, future_class_parents, future_class_attrs):\\n    \"\"\"\\n      Return a class object, with the list of its attribute turned\\n      into uppercase.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # pick up any attribute that doesn\\'t start with \\'__\\' and uppercase it\\n    uppercase_attrs = {\\n        attr if attr.startswith(\"__\") else attr.upper(): v\\n        for attr, v in future_class_attrs.items()\\n    }\\n\\n    # let `type` do the class creation\\n    return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attrs)\\n\\n__metaclass__ = upper_attr # this will affect all classes in the module\\n\\nclass Foo(): # global __metaclass__ won\\'t work with \"object\" though\\n    # but we can define __metaclass__ here instead to affect only this class\\n    # and this will work with \"object\" children\\n    bar = \\'bip\\'\\nLet\\'s check:>>> hasattr(Foo, \\'bar\\')\\nFalse\\n>>> hasattr(Foo, \\'BAR\\')\\nTrue\\n>>> Foo.BAR\\n\\'bip\\'\\nNow, let\\'s do exactly the same, but using a real class for a metaclass:# remember that `type` is actually a class like `str` and `int`\\n# so you can inherit from it\\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\\n    # __new__ is the method called before __init__\\n    # it\\'s the method that creates the object and returns it\\n    # while __init__ just initializes the object passed as parameter\\n    # you rarely use __new__, except when you want to control how the object\\n    # is created.\\n    # here the created object is the class, and we want to customize it\\n    # so we override __new__\\n    # you can do some stuff in __init__ too if you wish\\n    # some advanced use involves overriding __call__ as well, but we won\\'t\\n    # see this\\n    def __new__(upperattr_metaclass, future_class_name,\\n                future_class_parents, future_class_attrs):\\n        uppercase_attrs = {\\n            attr if attr.startswith(\"__\") else attr.upper(): v\\n            for attr, v in future_class_attrs.items()\\n        }\\n        return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attrs)\\nLet\\'s rewrite the above, but with shorter and more realistic variable names now that we know what they mean:class UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, attrs):\\n        uppercase_attrs = {\\n            attr if attr.startswith(\"__\") else attr.upper(): v\\n            for attr, v in attrs.items()\\n        }\\n        return type(clsname, bases, uppercase_attrs)\\nYou may have noticed the extra argument cls. There is\\nnothing special about it: __new__ always receives the class it\\'s defined in, as the first parameter. Just like you have self for ordinary methods which receive the instance as the first parameter, or the defining class for class methods.cls__new__selfBut this is not proper OOP. We are calling type directly and we aren\\'t overriding or calling the parent\\'s __new__. Let\\'s do that instead:type__new__class UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, attrs):\\n        uppercase_attrs = {\\n            attr if attr.startswith(\"__\") else attr.upper(): v\\n            for attr, v in attrs.items()\\n        }\\n        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attrs)\\nWe can make it even cleaner by using super, which will ease inheritance (because yes, you can have metaclasses, inheriting from metaclasses, inheriting from type):superclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, attrs):\\n        uppercase_attrs = {\\n            attr if attr.startswith(\"__\") else attr.upper(): v\\n            for attr, v in attrs.items()\\n        }\\n\\n        # Python 2 requires passing arguments to super:\\n        return super(UpperAttrMetaclass, cls).__new__(\\n            cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attrs)\\n\\n        # Python 3 can use no-arg super() which infers them:\\n        return super().__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attrs)\\nOh, and in Python 3 if you do this call with keyword arguments, like this:class Foo(object, metaclass=MyMetaclass, kwarg1=value1):\\n    ...\\nIt translates to this in the metaclass to use it:class MyMetaclass(type):\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct, kwargs1=default):\\n        ...\\nThat\\'s it. There is really nothing more about metaclasses.The reason behind the complexity of the code using metaclasses is not because\\nof metaclasses, it\\'s because you usually use metaclasses to do twisted stuff\\nrelying on introspection, manipulating inheritance, vars such as __dict__, etc.__dict__Indeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore\\ncomplicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:Since __metaclass__ can accept any callable, why would you use a class\\nsince it\\'s obviously more complicated?__metaclass__There are several reasons to do so:UpperAttrMetaclass(type)__new____init____call____new____init__Now the big question. Why would you use some obscure error-prone feature?Well, usually you don\\'t:Metaclasses are deeper magic that\\n99% of users should never worry about it.\\nIf you wonder whether you need them,\\nyou don\\'t (the people who actually\\nneed them know with certainty that\\nthey need them, and don\\'t need an\\nexplanation about why).Python Guru Tim PetersThe main use case for a metaclass is creating an API. A typical example of this is the Django ORM. It allows you to define something like this:class Person(models.Model):\\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\\n    age = models.IntegerField()\\nBut if you do this:person = Person(name=\\'bob\\', age=\\'35\\')\\nprint(person.age)\\nIt won\\'t return an IntegerField object. It will return an int, and can even take it directly from the database.IntegerFieldintThis is possible because models.Model defines __metaclass__ and\\nit uses some magic that will turn the Person you just defined with simple statements\\ninto a complex hook to a database field.models.Model__metaclass__PersonDjango makes something complex look simple by exposing a simple API\\nand using metaclasses, recreating code from this API to do the real job\\nbehind the scenes.First, you know that classes are objects that can create instances.Well, in fact, classes are themselves instances. Of metaclasses.>>> class Foo(object): pass\\n>>> id(Foo)\\n142630324\\nEverything is an object in Python, and they are all either instance of classes\\nor instances of metaclasses.Except for type.typetype is actually its own metaclass. This is not something you could\\nreproduce in pure Python, and is done by cheating a little bit at the implementation\\nlevel.typeSecondly, metaclasses are complicated. You may not want to use them for\\nvery simple class alterations. You can change classes by using two different techniques:monkey patching99% of the time you need class alteration, you are better off using these.But 98% of the time, you don\\'t need class alteration at all.',\n",
              "   'A metaclass is the class of a class. A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the better approach is to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won\\'t be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.JerubtypetypetypetypeA metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. When you create an object by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the \\'class\\' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do \\'extra things\\' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry or replace the class with something else entirely.__init____new__When the class statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it.classclass__metaclass____metaclass__However, metaclasses actually define the type of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. You can also define the normal \\'magic\\' methods, like __add__, __iter__ and __getattr__, to implement or change how the class behaves.type.__subclasses__()type__add____iter____getattr__Here\\'s an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:def make_hook(f):\\n    \"\"\"Decorator to turn \\'foo\\' method into \\'__foo__\\'\"\"\"\\n    f.is_hook = 1\\n    return f\\n\\nclass MyType(type):\\n    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, attrs):\\n\\n        if name.startswith(\\'None\\'):\\n            return None\\n\\n        # Go over attributes and see if they should be renamed.\\n        newattrs = {}\\n        for attrname, attrvalue in attrs.iteritems():\\n            if getattr(attrvalue, \\'is_hook\\', 0):\\n                newattrs[\\'__%s__\\' % attrname] = attrvalue\\n            else:\\n                newattrs[attrname] = attrvalue\\n\\n        return super(MyType, mcls).__new__(mcls, name, bases, newattrs)\\n\\n    def __init__(self, name, bases, attrs):\\n        super(MyType, self).__init__(name, bases, attrs)\\n\\n        # classregistry.register(self, self.interfaces)\\n        print \"Would register class %s now.\" % self\\n\\n    def __add__(self, other):\\n        class AutoClass(self, other):\\n            pass\\n        return AutoClass\\n        # Alternatively, to autogenerate the classname as well as the class:\\n        # return type(self.__name__ + other.__name__, (self, other), {})\\n\\n    def unregister(self):\\n        # classregistry.unregister(self)\\n        print \"Would unregister class %s now.\" % self\\n\\nclass MyObject:\\n    __metaclass__ = MyType\\n\\n\\nclass NoneSample(MyObject):\\n    pass\\n\\n# Will print \"NoneType None\"\\nprint type(NoneSample), repr(NoneSample)\\n\\nclass Example(MyObject):\\n    def __init__(self, value):\\n        self.value = value\\n    @make_hook\\n    def add(self, other):\\n        return self.__class__(self.value + other.value)\\n\\n# Will unregister the class\\nExample.unregister()\\n\\ninst = Example(10)\\n# Will fail with an AttributeError\\n#inst.unregister()\\n\\nprint inst + inst\\nclass Sibling(MyObject):\\n    pass\\n\\nExampleSibling = Example + Sibling\\n# ExampleSibling is now a subclass of both Example and Sibling (with no\\n# content of its own) although it will believe it\\'s called \\'AutoClass\\'\\nprint ExampleSibling\\nprint ExampleSibling.__mro__\\n',\n",

It\\'s an instance of a metaclass (also pseudocode):Class>>> Metaclass(...)\\nClass\\nIn real code, we can pass the default metaclass, type, everything we need to instantiate a class and we get a class:type>>> type(\\'Foo\\', (object,), {}) # requires a name, bases, and a namespace\\n<class \\'__main__.Foo\\'>\\nA class is to an instance as a metaclass is to a class. When we instantiate an object, we get an instance:>>> object()                          # instantiation of class\\n<object object at 0x7f9069b4e0b0>     # instance\\nLikewise, when we define a class explicitly with the default metaclass, type, we instantiate it:type>>> type(\\'Object\\', (object,), {})     # instantiation of metaclass\\n<class \\'__main__.Object\\'>             # instance\\nPut another way, a class is an instance of a metaclass:>>> isinstance(object, type)\\nTrue\\nPut a third way, a metaclass is a class\\'s class.>>> type(object) == type\\nTrue\\n>>> object.__class__\\n<class \\'type\\'>\\nWhen you write a class definition and Python executes it, it uses a metaclass to instantiate the class object (which will, in turn, be used to instantiate instances of that class).Just as we can use class definitions to change how custom object instances behave, we can use a metaclass class definition to change the way a class object behaves.What can they be used for? From the docs:docsThe potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have been explored include logging, interface checking, automatic delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and automatic resource locking/synchronization.Nevertheless, it is usually encouraged for users to avoid using metaclasses unless absolutely necessary.When you write a class definition, for example, like this,class Foo(object): \\n    \\'demo\\'\\nYou instantiate a class object.>>> Foo\\n<class \\'__main__.Foo\\'>\\n>>> isinstance(Foo, type), isinstance(Foo, object)\\n(True, True)\\nIt is the same as functionally calling type with the appropriate arguments and assigning the result to a variable of that name:typename = \\'Foo\\'\\nbases = (object,)\\nnamespace = {\\'__doc__\\': \\'demo\\'}\\nFoo = type(name, bases, namespace)\\nNote, some things automatically get added to the __dict__, i.e., the namespace:__dict__>>> Foo.__dict__\\ndict_proxy({\\'__dict__\\': <attribute \\'__dict__\\' of \\'Foo\\' objects>, \\n\\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__weakref__\\': <attribute \\'__weakref__\\' \\nof \\'Foo\\' objects>, \\'__doc__\\': \\'demo\\'})\\nThe metaclass of the object we created, in both cases, is type. type(A side-note on the contents of the class __dict__: __module__ is there because classes must know where they are defined, and  __dict__ and __weakref__ are there because we don\\'t define __slots__ - if we define __slots__ we\\'ll save a bit of space in the instances, as we can disallow __dict__ and __weakref__ by excluding them. For example:__dict____module____dict____weakref____slots__define __slots____slots____dict____weakref__>>> Baz = type(\\'Bar\\', (object,), {\\'__doc__\\': \\'demo\\', \\'__slots__\\': ()})\\n>>> Baz.__dict__\\nmappingproxy({\\'__doc__\\': \\'demo\\', \\'__slots__\\': (), \\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\'})\\n... but I digress.)typeHere\\'s the default __repr__ of classes:__repr__>>> Foo\\n<class \\'__main__.Foo\\'>\\nOne of the most valuable things we can do by default in writing a Python object is to provide it with a good __repr__. When we call help(repr) we learn that there\\'s a good test for a __repr__ that also requires a test for equality - obj == eval(repr(obj)). The following simple implementation of __repr__ and __eq__ for class instances of our type class provides us with a demonstration that may improve on the default __repr__ of classes:__repr__help(repr)__repr__obj == eval(repr(obj))__repr____eq____repr__class Type(type):\\n    def __repr__(cls):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        >>> Baz\\n        Type(\\'Baz\\', (Foo, Bar,), {\\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__doc__\\': None})\\n        >>> eval(repr(Baz))\\n        Type(\\'Baz\\', (Foo, Bar,), {\\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__doc__\\': None})\\n        \"\"\"\\n        metaname = type(cls).__name__\\n        name = cls.__name__\\n        parents = \\', \\'.join(b.__name__ for b in cls.__bases__)\\n        if parents:\\n            parents += \\',\\'\\n        namespace = \\', \\'.join(\\': \\'.join(\\n          (repr(k), repr(v) if not isinstance(v, type) else v.__name__))\\n               for k, v in cls.__dict__.items())\\n        return \\'{0}(\\\\\\'{1}\\\\\\', ({2}), {{{3}}})\\'.format(metaname, name, parents, namespace)\\n    def __eq__(cls, other):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        >>> Baz == eval(repr(Baz))\\n        True            \\n        \"\"\"\\n        return (cls.__name__, cls.__bases__, cls.__dict__) == (\\n                other.__name__, other.__bases__, other.__dict__)\\nSo now when we create an object with this metaclass, the __repr__ echoed on the command line provides a much less ugly sight than the default:__repr__>>> class Bar(object): pass\\n>>> Baz = Type(\\'Baz\\', (Foo, Bar,), {\\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__doc__\\': None})\\n>>> Baz\\nType(\\'Baz\\', (Foo, Bar,), {\\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__doc__\\': None})\\nWith a nice __repr__ defined for the class instance, we have a stronger ability to debug our code. However, much further checking with eval(repr(Class)) is unlikely (as functions would be rather impossible to eval from their default __repr__\\'s).__repr__eval(repr(Class))__repr____prepare__If, for example, we want to know in what order a class\\'s methods are created in, we could provide an ordered dict as the namespace of the class. We would do this with __prepare__ which returns the namespace dict for the class if it is implemented in Python 3: __prepare__returns the namespace dict for the class if it is implemented in Python 3from collections import OrderedDict\\n\\nclass OrderedType(Type):\\n    @classmethod\\n    def __prepare__(metacls, name, bases, **kwargs):\\n        return OrderedDict()\\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):\\n        result = Type.__new__(cls, name, bases, dict(namespace))\\n        result.members = tuple(namespace)\\n        return result\\nAnd usage:class OrderedMethodsObject(object, metaclass=OrderedType):\\n    def method1(self): pass\\n    def method2(self): pass\\n    def method3(self): pass\\n    def method4(self): pass\\nAnd now we have a record of the order in which these methods (and other class attributes) were created:>>> OrderedMethodsObject.members\\n(\\'__module__\\', \\'__qualname__\\', \\'method1\\', \\'method2\\', \\'method3\\', \\'method4\\')\\nNote, this example was adapted from the documentation - the new enum in the standard library does this.documentationenum in the standard librarySo what we did was instantiate a metaclass by creating a class. We can also treat the metaclass as we would any other class. It has a method resolution order:>>> inspect.getmro(OrderedType)\\n(<class \\'__main__.OrderedType\\'>, <class \\'__main__.Type\\'>, <class \\'type\\'>, <class \\'object\\'>)\\nAnd it has approximately the correct repr (which we can no longer eval unless we can find a way to represent our functions.):repr>>> OrderedMethodsObject\\nOrderedType(\\'OrderedMethodsObject\\', (object,), {\\'method1\\': <function OrderedMethodsObject.method1 at 0x0000000002DB01E0>, \\'members\\': (\\'__module__\\', \\'__qualname__\\', \\'method1\\', \\'method2\\', \\'method3\\', \\'method4\\'), \\'method3\\': <function OrderedMet\\nhodsObject.method3 at 0x0000000002DB02F0>, \\'method2\\': <function OrderedMethodsObject.method2 at 0x0000000002DB0268>, \\'__module__\\': \\'__main__\\', \\'__weakref__\\': <attribute \\'__weakref__\\' of \\'OrderedMethodsObject\\' objects>, \\'__doc__\\': None, \\'__d\\nict__\\': <attribute \\'__dict__\\' of \\'OrderedMethodsObject\\' objects>, \\'method4\\': <function OrderedMethodsObject.method4 at 0x0000000002DB0378>})\\n',\n",
              "   'Python 3 updateThere are (at this point) two key methods in a metaclass:__prepare____new____prepare__ lets you supply a custom mapping (such as an OrderedDict) to be used as the namespace while the class is being created.

If you don\\'t implement __prepare__ a normal dict is used.__prepare__OrderedDict__prepare__dict__new__ is responsible for the actual creation/modification of the final class.__new__A bare-bones, do-nothing-extra metaclass would like:class Meta(type):\\n\\n    def __prepare__(metaclass, cls, bases):\\n        return dict()\\n\\n    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict):\\n        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict)\\nA simple example:Say you want some simple validation code to run on your attributes -- like it must always be an int or a str.  Without a metaclass, your class would look something like:intstrclass Person:\\n    weight = ValidateType(\\'weight\\', int)\\n    age = ValidateType(\\'age\\', int)\\n    name = ValidateType(\\'name\\', str)\\nAs you can see, you have to repeat the name of the attribute twice.  This makes typos possible along with irritating bugs.A simple metaclass can address that problem:class Person(metaclass=Validator):\\n    weight = ValidateType(int)\\n    age = ValidateType(int)\\n    name = ValidateType(str)\\nThis is what the metaclass would look like (not using __prepare__ since it is not needed):__prepare__class Validator(type):\\n    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict):\\n        # search clsdict looking for ValidateType descriptors\\n        for name, attr in clsdict.items():\\n            if isinstance(attr, ValidateType):\\n                attr.name = name\\n                attr.attr = \\'_\\' + name\\n        # create final class and return it\\n        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict)\\nA sample run of:p = Person()\\np.weight = 9\\nprint(p.weight)\\np.weight = \\'9\\'\\nproduces:9\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"simple_meta.py\", line 36, in <module>\\n    p.weight = \\'9\\'\\n  File \"simple_meta.py\", line 24, in __set__\\n    (self.name, self.type, value))\\nTypeError: weight must be of type(s) <class \\'int\\'> (got \\'9\\')\\nNote:  This example is simple enough it could have also been accomplished with a class decorator, but presumably an actual metaclass would be doing much more.The \\'ValidateType\\' class for reference:class ValidateType:\\n    def __init__(self, type):\\n        self.name = None  # will be set by metaclass\\n        self.attr = None  # will be set by metaclass\\n        self.type = type\\n    def __get__(self, inst, cls):\\n        if inst is None:\\n            return self\\n        else:\\n            return inst.__dict__[self.attr]\\n    def __set__(self, inst, value):\\n        if not isinstance(value, self.type):\\n            raise TypeError(\\'%s must be of type(s) %s (got %r)\\' %\\n                    (self.name, self.type, value))\\n        else:\\n            inst.__dict__[self.attr] = value\\n',\n",

But as we\\'ve seen from previous answers a class itself is an instance of a metaclass, so when we use the class as a callable (i.e. when we create an instance of it) we\\'re actually calling its metaclass\\' __call__() method. At this point most Python programmers are a bit confused because they\\'ve been told that when creating an instance like this instance = SomeClass() you\\'re calling its __init__() method. Some who\\'ve dug a bit deeper know that before __init__() there\\'s __new__(). Well, today another layer of truth is being revealed, before __new__() there\\'s the metaclass\\' __call__().__call__()__call__()instance = SomeClass()__init__()__init__()__new__()__new__()__call__()Let\\'s study the method call chain from specifically the perspective of creating an instance of a class.This is a metaclass that logs exactly the moment before an instance is created and the moment it\\'s about to return it.class Meta_1(type):\\n    def __call__(cls):\\n        print \"Meta_1.__call__() before creating an instance of \", cls\\n        instance = super(Meta_1, cls).__call__()\\n        print \"Meta_1.__call__() about to return instance.\"\\n        return instance\\nThis is a class that uses that metaclassclass Class_1(object):\\n\\n    __metaclass__ = Meta_1\\n\\n    def __new__(cls):\\n        print \"Class_1.__new__() before creating an instance.\"\\n        instance = super(Class_1, cls).__new__(cls)\\n        print \"Class_1.__new__() about to return instance.\"\\n        return instance\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        print \"entering Class_1.__init__() for instance initialization.\"\\n        super(Class_1,self).__init__()\\n        print \"exiting Class_1.__init__().\"\\nAnd now let\\'s create an instance of Class_1Class_1instance = Class_1()\\n# Meta_1.__call__() before creating an instance of <class \\'__main__.Class_1\\'>.\\n# Class_1.__new__() before creating an instance.\\n# Class_1.__new__() about to return instance.\\n# entering Class_1.__init__() for instance initialization.\\n# exiting Class_1.__init__().\\n# Meta_1.__call__() about to return instance.\\nObserve that the code above doesn\\'t actually do anything more than logging the tasks. Each method delegates the actual work to its parent\\'s implementation, thus keeping the default behavior. Since type is Meta_1\\'s parent class (type being the default parent metaclass) and considering the ordering sequence of the output above, we now have a clue as to what would be the pseudo implementation of type.__call__():typeMeta_1typetype.__call__()class type:\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwarg):\\n\\n        # ... maybe a few things done to cls here\\n\\n        # then we call __new__() on the class to create an instance\\n        instance = cls.__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)\\n\\n        # ... maybe a few things done to the instance here\\n\\n        # then we initialize the instance with its __init__() method\\n        instance.__init__(*args, **kwargs)\\n\\n        # ... maybe a few more things done to instance here\\n\\n        # then we return it\\n        return instance\\nWe can see that the metaclass\\' __call__() method is the one that\\'s called first. It then delegates creation of the instance to the class\\'s __new__() method and initialization to the instance\\'s __init__(). It\\'s also the one that ultimately returns the instance.__call__()__new__()__init__()From the above it stems that the metaclass\\' __call__() is also given the opportunity to decide whether or not a call to Class_1.__new__() or Class_1.__init__() will eventually be made. Over the course of its execution it could actually return an object that hasn\\'t been touched by either of these methods. Take for example this approach to the singleton pattern:__call__()Class_1.__new__()Class_1.__init__()class Meta_2(type):\\n    singletons = {}\\n\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if cls in Meta_2.singletons:\\n            # we return the only instance and skip a call to __new__()\\n            # and __init__()\\n            print (\"{} singleton returning from Meta_2.__call__(), \"\\n                   \"skipping creation of new instance.\".format(cls))\\n            return Meta_2.singletons[cls]\\n\\n        # else if the singleton isn\\'t present we proceed as usual\\n        print \"Meta_2.__call__() before creating an instance.\"\\n        instance = super(Meta_2, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        Meta_2.singletons[cls] = instance\\n        print \"Meta_2.__call__() returning new instance.\"\\n        return instance\\n\\nclass Class_2(object):\\n\\n    __metaclass__ = Meta_2\\n\\n    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        print \"Class_2.__new__() before creating instance.\"\\n        instance = super(Class_2, cls).__new__(cls)\\n        print \"Class_2.__new__() returning instance.\"\\n        return instance\\n\\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\\n        print \"entering Class_2.__init__() for initialization.\"\\n        super(Class_2, self).__init__()\\n        print \"exiting Class_2.__init__().\"\\nLet\\'s observe what happens when repeatedly trying to create an object of type Class_2Class_2a = Class_2()\\n# Meta_2.__call__() before creating an instance.\\n# Class_2.__new__() before creating instance.\\n# Class_2.__new__() returning instance.\\n# entering Class_2.__init__() for initialization.\\n# exiting Class_2.__init__().\\n# Meta_2.__call__() returning new instance.\\n\\nb = Class_2()\\n# <class \\'__main__.Class_2\\'> singleton returning from Meta_2.__call__(), skipping creation of new instance.\\n\\nc = Class_2()\\n# <class \\'__main__.Class_2\\'> singleton returning from Meta_2.__call__(), skipping creation of new instance.\\n\\na is b is c # True\\n',\n",

Here it is...metaclassmetaclass#!/usr/bin/env python\\n\\n# Copyright (C) 2013-2014 Craig Phillips.  All rights reserved.\\n\\n# This requires some explaining.  The point of this metaclass excercise is to\\n# create a static abstract class that is in one way or another, dormant until\\n# queried.  I experimented with creating a singlton on import, but that did\\n# not quite behave how I wanted it to.  See now here, we are creating a class\\n# called GsyncOptions, that on import, will do nothing except state that its\\n# class creator is GsyncOptionsType.  This means, docopt doesn\\'t parse any\\n# of the help document, nor does it start processing command line options.\\n# So importing this module becomes really efficient.  The complicated bit\\n# comes from requiring the GsyncOptions class to be static.  By that, I mean\\n# any property on it, may or may not exist, since they are not statically\\n# defined; so I can\\'t simply just define the class with a whole bunch of\\n# properties that are @property @staticmethods.\\n#\\n# So here\\'s how it works:\\n#\\n# Executing \\'from libgsync.options import GsyncOptions\\' does nothing more\\n# than load up this module, define the Type and the Class and import them\\n# into the callers namespace.  Simple.\\n#\\n# Invoking \\'GsyncOptions.debug\\' for the first time, or any other property\\n# causes the __metaclass__ __getattr__ method to be called, since the class\\n# is not instantiated as a class instance yet.  The __getattr__ method on\\n# the type then initialises the class (GsyncOptions) via the __initialiseClass\\n# method.  This is the first and only time the class will actually have its\\n# dictionary statically populated.  The docopt module is invoked to parse the\\n# usage document and generate command line options from it.  These are then\\n# paired with their defaults and what\\'s in sys.argv.  After all that, we\\n# setup some dynamic properties that could not be defined by their name in\\n# the usage, before everything is then transplanted onto the actual class\\n# object (or static class GsyncOptions).\\n#\\n# Another piece of magic, is to allow command line options to be set in\\n# in their native form and be translated into argparse style properties.\\n#\\n# Finally, the GsyncListOptions class is actually where the options are\\n# stored.  This only acts as a mechanism for storing options as lists, to\\n# allow aggregation of duplicate options or options that can be specified\\n# multiple times.  The __getattr__ call hides this by default, returning the\\n# last item in a property\\'s list.  However, if the entire list is required,\\n# calling the \\'list()\\' method on the GsyncOptions class, returns a reference\\n# to the GsyncListOptions class, which contains all of the same properties\\n# but as lists and without the duplication of having them as both lists and\\n# static singlton values.\\n#\\n# So this actually means that GsyncOptions is actually a static proxy class...\\n#\\n# ...And all this is neatly hidden within a closure for safe keeping.\\ndef GetGsyncOptionsType():\\n    class GsyncListOptions(object):\\n        __initialised = False\\n\\n    class GsyncOptionsType(type):\\n        def __initialiseClass(cls):\\n            if GsyncListOptions._GsyncListOptions__initialised: return\\n\\n            from docopt import docopt\\n            from libgsync.options import doc\\n            from libgsync import __version__\\n\\n            options = docopt(\\n                doc.__doc__ % __version__,\\n                version = __version__,\\n                options_first = True\\n            )\\n\\n            paths = options.pop(\\'<path>\\', None)\\n            setattr(cls, \"destination_path\", paths.pop() if paths else None)\\n            setattr(cls, \"source_paths\", paths)\\n            setattr(cls, \"options\", options)\\n\\n            for k, v in options.iteritems():\\n                setattr(cls, k, v)\\n\\n            GsyncListOptions._GsyncListOptions__initialised = True\\n\\n        def list(cls):\\n            return GsyncListOptions\\n\\n        def __getattr__(cls, name):\\n            cls.__initialiseClass()\\n            return getattr(GsyncListOptions, name)[-1]\\n\\n        def __setattr__(cls, name, value):\\n            # Substitut option names: --an-option-name for an_option_name\\n            import re\\n            name = re.sub(r\\'^__\\', \"\", re.sub(r\\'-\\', \"_\", name))\\n            listvalue = []\\n\\n            # Ensure value is converted to a list type for GsyncListOptions\\n            if isinstance(value, list):\\n                if value:\\n                    listvalue = [] + value\\n                else:\\n                    listvalue = [ None ]\\n            else:\\n                listvalue = [ value ]\\n\\n            type.__setattr__(GsyncListOptions, name, listvalue)\\n\\n    # Cleanup this module to prevent tinkering.\\n    import sys\\n    module = sys.modules[__name__]\\n    del module.__dict__[\\'GetGsyncOptionsType\\']\\n\\n    return GsyncOptionsType\\n\\n# Our singlton abstract proxy class.\\nclass GsyncOptions(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = GetGsyncOptionsType()\\n',\n",

With try, you simply attempt to read your file, expecting it to be there, and if not, you catch the exception and perform whatever fallback behavior makes sense.trytryIf you want to check that a file exists before you attempt to read it, and you might be deleting it and then you might be using multiple threads or processes, or another program knows about that file and could delete it - you risk the chance of a race condition if you check it exists, because you are then racing to open it before its condition (its existence) changes. Race conditions are very hard to debug because there\\'s a very small window in which they can cause your program to fail.But if this is your motivation, you can get the value of a try statement by using the suppress context manager.trysuppresssuppressPython 3.4 gives us the suppress context manager (previously the ignore context manager), which does semantically exactly the same thing in fewer lines, while also (at least superficially) meeting the original ask to avoid a try statement:suppresssuppressignoreignoretryfrom contextlib import suppress\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nUsage:>>> with suppress(OSError), Path(\\'doesnotexist\\').open() as f:\\n...     for line in f:\\n...         print(line)\\n... \\n>>>\\n>>> with suppress(OSError):\\n...     Path(\\'doesnotexist\\').unlink()\\n... \\n>>> \\nFor earlier Pythons, you could roll your own suppress, but without a try will be more verbose than with. I do believe this actually is the only answer that doesn\\'t use try at any level in the Python that can be applied to prior to Python 3.4 because it uses a context manager instead:suppresstrytryclass suppress(object):\\n    def __init__(self, *exceptions):\\n        self.exceptions = exceptions\\n    def __enter__(self):\\n        return self\\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\\n        if exc_type is not None:\\n            return issubclass(exc_type, self.exceptions)\\nPerhaps easier with a try:from contextlib import contextmanager\\n\\n@contextmanager\\ndef suppress(*exceptions):\\n    try:\\n        yield\\n    except exceptions:\\n        pass\\nisfileimport os\\nos.path.isfile(path)\\nfrom the docs:docsos.path.isfile(path)os.path.isfile(path)Return True if path is an existing regular file.

In Python 3, this will fail because you\\'re adding two dict_items objects together, not two lists -dict_items>>> c = dict(a.items() + b.items())\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: \\'dict_items\\' and \\'dict_items\\'\\nand you would have to explicitly create them as lists, e.g. z = dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items())). This is a waste of resources and computation power.z = dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items()))Similarly, taking the union of items() in Python 3 (viewitems() in Python 2.7) will also fail when values are unhashable objects (like lists, for example). Even if your values are hashable, since sets are semantically unordered, the behavior is undefined in regards to precedence. So don\\'t do this:items()viewitems()>>> c = dict(a.items() | b.items())\\nThis example demonstrates what happens when values are unhashable:>>> x = {\\'a\\': []}\\n>>> y = {\\'b\\': []}\\n>>> dict(x.items() | y.items())\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: unhashable type: \\'list\\'\\nHere\\'s an example where y should have precedence, but instead the value from x is retained due to the arbitrary order of sets:yx>>> x = {\\'a\\': 2}\\n>>> y = {\\'a\\': 1}\\n>>> dict(x.items() | y.items())\\n{\\'a\\': 2}\\nAnother hack you should not use:z = dict(x, **y)\\nThis uses the dict constructor and is very fast and memory-efficient (even slightly more so than our two-step process) but unless you know precisely what is happening here (that is, the second dict is being passed as keyword arguments to the dict constructor), it\\'s difficult to read, it\\'s not the intended usage, and so it is not Pythonic.dictHere\\'s an example of the usage being remediated in django.remediated in djangoDictionaries are intended to take hashable keys (e.g. frozensets or tuples), but this method fails in Python 3 when keys are not strings.frozenset>>> c = dict(a, **b)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: keyword arguments must be strings\\nFrom the mailing list, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, wrote:mailing listI am fine with\\ndeclaring dict({}, **{1:3}) illegal, since after all it is abuse of\\nthe ** mechanism.andApparently dict(x, **y) is going around as \"cool hack\" for \"call\\nx.update(y) and return x\".

The fact that this only works for string keys is a direct consequence of how keyword parameters work and not a short-coming of dict. Nor is using the ** operator in this place an abuse of the mechanism, in fact, ** was designed precisely to pass dictionaries as keywords.dict(x, **y)Again, it doesn\\'t work for 3 when keys are not strings. The implicit calling contract is that namespaces take ordinary dictionaries, while users must only pass keyword arguments that are strings. All other callables enforced it. dict broke this consistency in Python 2:dict>>> foo(**{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None})\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: foo() keywords must be strings\\n>>> dict(**{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None})\\n{(\\'a\\', \\'b\\'): None}\\nThis inconsistency was bad given other implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython). Thus it was fixed in Python 3, as this usage could be a breaking change.I submit to you that it is malicious incompetence to intentionally write code that only works in one version of a language or that only works given certain arbitrary constraints.More comments:dict(x.items() + y.items()) is still the most readable solution for Python 2. Readability counts.dict(x.items() + y.items())My response: merge_two_dicts(x, y) actually seems much clearer to me, if we\\'re actually concerned about readability.

In my interpretation of the word \"merging\" these answers describe \"updating one dict with another\", and not merging.{**x, **y}Yes. I must refer you back to the question, which is asking for a shallow merge of two dictionaries, with the first\\'s values being overwritten by the second\\'s - in a single expression.Assuming two dictionaries of dictionaries, one might recursively merge them in a single function, but you should be careful not to modify the dictionaries from either source, and the surest way to avoid that is to make a copy when assigning values. As keys must be hashable and are usually therefore immutable, it is pointless to copy them:from copy import deepcopy\\n\\ndef dict_of_dicts_merge(x, y):\\n    z = {}\\n    overlapping_keys = x.keys() & y.keys()\\n    for key in overlapping_keys:\\n        z[key] = dict_of_dicts_merge(x[key], y[key])\\n    for key in x.keys() - overlapping_keys:\\n        z[key] = deepcopy(x[key])\\n    for key in y.keys() - overlapping_keys:\\n        z[key] = deepcopy(y[key])\\n    return z\\nUsage:>>> x = {\\'a\\':{1:{}}, \\'b\\': {2:{}}}\\n>>> y = {\\'b\\':{10:{}}, \\'c\\': {11:{}}}\\n>>> dict_of_dicts_merge(x, y)\\n{\\'b\\': {2: {}, 10: {}}, \\'a\\': {1: {}}, \\'c\\': {11: {}}}\\nComing up with contingencies for other value types is far beyond the scope of this question, so I will point you at my answer to the canonical question on a \"Dictionaries of dictionaries merge\".my answer to the canonical question on a \"Dictionaries of dictionaries merge\"These approaches are less performant, but they will provide correct behavior.\\nThey will be much less performant than copy and update or the new unpacking because they iterate through each key-value pair at a higher level of abstraction, but they do respect the order of precedence (latter dictionaries have precedence)copyupdateYou can also chain the dictionaries manually inside a dict comprehension:dict comprehension{k: v for d in dicts for k, v in d.items()} # iteritems in Python 2.7\\nor in Python 2.6 (and perhaps as early as 2.4 when generator expressions were introduced):dict((k, v) for d in dicts for k, v in d.items()) # iteritems in Python 2\\nitertools.chain will chain the iterators over the key-value pairs in the correct order:itertools.chainfrom itertools import chain\\nz = dict(chain(x.items(), y.items())) # iteritems in Python 2\\nI\\'m only going to do the performance analysis of the usages known to behave correctly.

Explicit is better than implicit.deepcopyIn addition, when you use .items() (pre Python 3.0), you\\'re creating a new list that contains the items from the dict.

In addition, keyword arguments for dictionary creation was only added in Python 2.3, whereas copy() and update() will work in older versions.',\n",
              "   'In a follow-up answer, you asked about the relative performance of these two alternatives:z1 = dict(x.items() + y.items())\\nz2 = dict(x, **y)\\nOn my machine, at least (a fairly ordinary x86_64 running Python 2.5.2), alternative z2 is not only shorter and simpler but also significantly faster.  You can verify this for yourself using the timeit module that comes with Python.z2timeitExample 1: identical dictionaries mapping 20 consecutive integers to themselves:% python -m timeit -s \\'x=y=dict((i,i) for i in range(20))\\' \\'z1=dict(x.items() + y.items())\\'\\n100000 loops, best of 3: 5.67 usec per loop\\n% python -m timeit -s \\'x=y=dict((i,i) for i in range(20))\\' \\'z2=dict(x, **y)\\' \\n100000 loops, best of 3: 1.53 usec per loop\\nz2 wins by a factor of 3.5 or so.  Different dictionaries seem to yield quite different results, but z2 always seems to come out ahead.  (If you get inconsistent results for the same test, try passing in -r with a number larger than the default 3.)z2z2-rExample 2: non-overlapping dictionaries mapping 252 short strings to integers and vice versa:% python -m timeit -s \\'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y\\' \\'z1=dict(x.items() + y.items())\\'\\n1000 loops, best of 3: 260 usec per loop\\n% python -m timeit -s \\'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y\\' \\'z2=dict(x, **y)\\'               \\n10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 usec per loop\\nz2 wins by about a factor of 10.  That\\'s a pretty big win in my book!z2After comparing those two, I wondered if z1\\'s poor performance could be attributed to the overhead of constructing the two item lists, which in turn led me to wonder if this variation might work better:z1from itertools import chain\\nz3 = dict(chain(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()))\\nA few quick tests, e.g.% python -m timeit -s \\'from itertools import chain; from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y\\' \\'z3=dict(chain(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()))\\'\\n10000 loops, best of 3: 66 usec per loop\\nlead me to conclude that z3 is somewhat faster than z1, but not nearly as fast as z2.  Definitely not worth all the extra typing.z3z1z2This discussion is still missing something important, which is a performance comparison of these alternatives with the \"obvious\" way of merging two lists: using the update method.  To try to keep things on an equal footing with the expressions, none of which modify x or y, I\\'m going to make a copy of x instead of modifying it in-place, as follows:updatez0 = dict(x)\\nz0.update(y)\\nA typical result:% python -m timeit -s \\'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y\\' \\'z0=dict(x); z0.update(y)\\'\\n10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 usec per loop\\nIn other words, z0 and z2 seem to have essentially identical performance.  Do you think this might be a coincidence?  I don\\'t....z0z2In fact, I\\'d go so far as to claim that it\\'s impossible for pure Python code to do any better than this.  And if you can do significantly better in a C extension module, I imagine the Python folks might well be interested in incorporating your code (or a variation on your approach) into the Python core.  Python uses dict in lots of places; optimizing its operations is a big deal.dictYou could also write this asz0 = x.copy()\\nz0.update(y)\\nas Tony does, but (not surprisingly) the difference in notation turns out not to have any measurable effect on performance.  Use whichever looks right to you.  Of course, he\\'s absolutely correct to point out that the two-statement version is much easier to understand.',\n",

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.Ajaxasynchronous$.ajaxreturn result;successHere is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.The same is happening when you make a function call containing \"normal\" code:function findItem() {\\n    var item;\\n    while(item_not_found) {\\n        // search\\n    }\\n    return item;\\n}\\n\\nvar item = findItem();\\n\\n// Do something with item\\ndoSomethingElse();\\nEven though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.findItemvar item = findItem();You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.That\\'s exactly what\\'s happening when you do an Ajax request.findItem(function(item) {\\n    // Do something with the item\\n});\\ndoSomethingElse();\\nInstead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does \"Ajax\"), it\\'s generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.Why is it bad do you ask?JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won\\'t be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:async/awaitthen()All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.async/awaitasync/awaitThe ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a \"synchronous style\". The code is still asynchronous, but it\\'s easier to read/understand.asyncawaitasync/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await \"unwraps\" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.async/awaitasyncawaitImportant: You can only use await inside an async function or in a JavaScript module. Top-level await is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context if not using a module.awaitasyncJavaScript moduleawaitImmediately Invoked Function ExpressionasyncYou can read more about async and await on MDN.asyncasyncawaitawaitHere is an example that elaborates the delay function findItem() above:findItem()// Using \\'superagent\\' which will return a promise.\\nvar superagent = require(\\'superagent\\')\\n\\n// This is isn\\'t declared as `async` because it already returns a promise\\nfunction delay() {\\n  // `delay` returns a promise\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\\n    }, 3000);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nasync function getAllBooks() {\\n  try {\\n    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user\\n    var bookIDs = await superagent.get(\\'/user/books\\');\\n    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)\\n    await delay();\\n    // GET information about each book\\n    return superagent.get(\\'/books/ids=\\'+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));\\n  } catch(error) {\\n    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block\\n    // would catch the rejection reason\\n    return null;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level\\n(async function(){\\n  let books = await getAllBooks();\\n  console.log(books);\\n})();\\nCurrent browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).browsernodeasync/awaitregeneratorBabelA callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So thisfoosuccessvar result = foo();\\n// Code that depends on \\'result\\'\\nbecomesfoo(function(result) {\\n    // Code that depends on \\'result\\'\\n});\\nHere we defined the function \"inline\" but you can pass any function reference:function myCallback(result) {\\n    // Code that depends on \\'result\\'\\n}\\n\\nfoo(myCallback);\\nfoo itself is defined as follows:foofunction foo(callback) {\\n    $.ajax({\\n        // ...\\n        success: callback\\n    });\\n}\\ncallback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).callbackfoosuccess$.ajaxcallbackresultYou can also process the response before passing it to the callback:function foo(callback) {\\n    $.ajax({\\n        // ...\\n        success: function(response) {\\n            // For example, filter the response\\n            callback(filtered_response);\\n        }\\n    });\\n}\\nIt\\'s easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.\\nDifficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.then()The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., bluebird).Promise APIbrowser supportbluebirdPromises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its \"listeners\" who want to access this value.The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.Here is an example of using a promise:function delay() {\\n  // `delay` returns a promise\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\\n    }, 3000);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\ndelay()\\n  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise\\n    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved\\n  })\\n  .catch(function(v) {\\n    // Or do something else if it is rejected\\n    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).\\n  });.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:function ajax(url) {\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n    xhr.onload = function() {\\n      resolve(this.responseText);\\n    };\\n    xhr.onerror = reject;\\n    xhr.open(\\'GET\\', url);\\n    xhr.send();\\n  });\\n}\\n\\najax(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\\n  .then(function(result) {\\n    console.log(result); // Code depending on result\\n  })\\n  .catch(function() {\\n    // An error occurred\\n  });.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.More information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises.HTML5 rocks - JavaScript PromisesDeferred objects are jQuery\\'s custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.Deferred objectsEvery Ajax method of jQuery already returns a \"deferred object\" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:function ajax() {\\n    return $.ajax(...);\\n}\\n\\najax().done(function(result) {\\n    // Code depending on result\\n}).fail(function() {\\n    // An error occurred\\n});\\nKeep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:function checkPassword() {\\n    return $.ajax({\\n        url: \\'/password\\',\\n        data: {\\n            username: $(\\'#username\\').val(),\\n            password: $(\\'#password\\').val()\\n        },\\n        type: \\'POST\\',\\n        dataType: \\'json\\'\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nif (checkPassword()) {\\n    // Tell the user they\\'re logged in\\n}\\nThis code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn\\'t freeze the code while it checks the \\'/password\\' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.$.ajax()iftrueBut the fix is easy:checkPassword()\\n.done(function(r) {\\n    if (r) {\\n        // Tell the user they\\'re logged in\\n    } else {\\n        // Tell the user their password was bad\\n    }\\n})\\n.fail(function(x) {\\n    // Tell the user something bad happened\\n});\\nAs I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don\\'t advocate their use, but for completeness\\' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.XMLHttpRequestXMLHttpRequestfalse.open.openIf you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8.\\nYou can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:jQueryasyncfalsesuccessresponseTextjqXHR objectfunction foo() {\\n    var jqXHR = $.ajax({\\n        //...\\n        async: false\\n    });\\n    return jqXHR.responseText;\\n}\\nIf you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).$.get$.getJSON$.ajax$.ajaxHeads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).JSONP',\n",

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called..send.sendreturn result;successThis means when you\\'re returning, the listener you\\'ve defined did not execute yet, which means the value you\\'re returning has not been defined.Here is a simple analogy:function getFive(){\\n    var a;\\n    setTimeout(function(){\\n         a=5;\\n    },10);\\n    return a;\\n}\\n(Fiddle)(Fiddle)The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you\\'re returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.aundefineda=5One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this\\n    alert(a);\\n}\\n\\nfunction getFive(whenDone){\\n    var a;\\n    setTimeout(function(){\\n         a=5;\\n         whenDone(a);\\n    },10);\\n}\\nThis is called CPS. Basically, we\\'re passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we\\'re telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).CPSgetFiveUsage would be:getFive(onComplete);\\nWhich should alert \"5\" to the screen. (Fiddle).(Fiddle)There are basically two ways how to solve this:As for synchronous AJAX, don\\'t do it! Felix\\'s answer raises some compelling arguments about why it\\'s a bad idea. To sum it up, it\\'ll freeze the user\\'s browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...If you have to do it, you can pass a flag. Here is how:Here is howvar request = new XMLHttpRequest();\\nrequest.open(\\'GET\\', \\'yourURL\\', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous\\nrequest.send(null);\\n\\nif (request.status === 200) {// That\\'s HTTP for \\'ok\\'\\n  console.log(request.responseText);\\n}\\nLet your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We\\'ll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.foofooSo:var result = foo();\\n// Code that depends on `result` goes here\\nBecomes:foo(function(result) {\\n    // Code that depends on `result`\\n});\\nHere we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:function myHandler(result) {\\n    // Code that depends on `result`\\n}\\nfoo(myHandler);\\nFor more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix\\'s answer.Now, let\\'s define foo itself to act accordinglyfunction foo(callback) {\\n    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // When the request is loaded\\n       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// We\\'re calling our method\\n    };\\n    httpRequest.open(\\'GET\\', \"/echo/json\");\\n    httpRequest.send();\\n}\\n(fiddle)(fiddle)We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.If you\\'re still having a hard time understanding this, read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.read the AJAX getting started guide',\n",
              "   \"XMLHttpRequest 2 (first of all, read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum and Felix Kling)XMLHttpRequestBenjamin GruenbaumFelix KlingIf you don't use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:function ajax(a, b, c){ // URL, callback, just a placeholder\\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\\n  c.open('GET', a);\\n  c.onload = b;\\n  c.send()\\n}\\nAs you can see:There are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):The simplest:this.response\\nOr if for some reason you bind() the callback to a class:bind()e.target.response\\nExample:function callback(e){\\n  console.log(this.response);\\n}\\najax('URL', callback);\\nOr (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):ajax('URL', function(e){console.log(this.response)});\\nNothing easier.Now some people will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That's wrong.Check out XMLHttpRequest advanced features.XMLHttpRequest advanced featuresIt supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.Using the XMLHttpRequest variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.XMLHttpRequestNow if you want something more complex using POST and FormData you can easily extend this function:POSTfunction x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val},placeholder\\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\\n  c.open(e||'get', a);\\n  c.onload = b;\\n  c.send(d||null)\\n}\\nAgain ... it's a very short function, but it does GET and POST.GETExamples of usage:x(url, callback); // By default it's GET so no need to set\\nx(url, callback, 'post', {'key': 'val'}); // No need to set POST data\\nOr pass a full form element (document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]):document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]var fd = new FormData(form);\\nx(url, callback, 'post', fd);\\nOr set some custom values:var fd = new FormData();\\nfd.append('key', 'val')\\nx(url, callback, 'post', fd);\\nAs you can see, I didn't implement sync... it's a bad thing.Having said that ... why don't we do it the easy way?As mentioned in the comment, the use of error && synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?Error handlerfunction x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val}, placeholder\\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\\n  c.open(e||'get', a);\\n  c.onload = b;\\n  c.onerror = error;\\n  c.send(d||null)\\n}\\n\\nfunction error(e){\\n  console.log('--Error--', this.type);\\n  console.log('this: ', this);\\n  console.log('Event: ', e)\\n}\\nfunction displayAjax(e){\\n  console.log(e, this);\\n}\\nx('WRONGURL', displayAjax);\\nIn the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.But to really get out an error, the only way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.Error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as the method it won't throw an error.Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.In the first case the error is inside the displayAjax() under this.statusText as Method not Allowed.displayAjax()this.statusTextMethod not AllowedIn the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.Cross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.In the error response, there aren't any error codes.There is only the this.type which is set to error.this.typeWhy add an error handler if you totally don't have any control over errors?\\nMost of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function displayAjax().displayAjax()So: There isn't any need for error checks if you're able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)PS: As the first test I wrote x('x', displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called 'x.xml'. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT. I LOL'dRead a file synchronousDon't do that.If you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big .txt file synchronous..txtfunction omg(a, c){ // URL\\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\\n  c.open('GET', a, true);\\n  c.send();\\n  return c; // Or c.response\\n}\\nNow you can do var res = omg('thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt');\\nThere is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)Another point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.The functions above are for basic use.If you want to extend the function...Yes, you can.I'm using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...But you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...But in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...But the question here is how to return an Ajax response...

Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.A Promise is a value over time. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:A promise can only change states once after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach then handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. then handlers allow chaining of calls. Promises are created by using APIs that return them. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement fetch or jQuery\\'s $.get return promises.thenthenchainingusing APIs that return themfetch$.getWhen we call .then on a promise and return something from it - we get a promise for the processed value. If we return another promise we\\'ll get amazing things, but let\\'s hold our horses..thenLet\\'s see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let\\'s demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the Promise constructor for creating a delay function:Promise constructorfunction delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds\\n    // Returns a new promise\\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\\n        setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,\\n            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\\n        }, ms);\\n    });\\n}\\nNow, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use then to make it count:converted setTimeoutthenfunction delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds\\n  // Returns a new promise\\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\\n    setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,\\n      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\\n    }, ms);\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nfunction getFive(){\\n  // We\\'re RETURNING the promise. Remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value\\n  return delay(100).then(function(){ // When the promise is ready,\\n      return 5; // return the value 5. Promises are all about return values\\n  })\\n}\\n// We _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, and we can\\'t access the plain value\\ngetFive().then(function(five){\\n   document.body.innerHTML = five;\\n});Basically, instead of returning a value which we can\\'t do because of the concurrency model - we\\'re returning a wrapper for a value that we can unwrap with then. It\\'s like a box you can open with then.thenthenThis stands the same for your original API call, you can:function foo() {\\n    // RETURN the promise\\n    return fetch(\"/echo/json\").then(function(response){\\n        return response.json(); // Process it inside the `then`\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nfoo().then(function(response){\\n    // Access the value inside the `then`\\n})\\nSo this works just as well. We\\'ve learned we can\\'t return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.ES6 introduces generators which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:generatorsfunction* foo(){ // Notice the star. This is ES6, so new browsers, Nodes.js, and io.js only\\n    yield 1;\\n    yield 2;\\n    while(true) yield 3;\\n}\\nIs a function that returns an iterator over the sequence 1,2,3,3,3,3,.... which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.1,2,3,3,3,3,....If the sequence we\\'re producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of future values - that is: promises.This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick let’s us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several \"runners\" that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I\\'ll be using Bluebird\\'s Promise.coroutine here, but there are other wrappers like co or Q.async.Promise.coroutinecoQ.asyncvar foo = coroutine(function*(){\\n    var data = yield fetch(\"/echo/json\"); // Notice the yield\\n    // The code here only executes _after_ the request is done\\n    return data.json(); // \\'data\\' is defined\\n});\\nThis method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:var main = coroutine(function*(){\\n   var bar = yield foo(); // Wait our earlier coroutine. It returns a promise\\n   // The server call is done here, and the code below executes when done\\n   var baz = yield fetch(\"/api/users/\" + bar.userid); // Depends on foo\\'s result\\n   console.log(baz); // Runs after both requests are done\\n});\\nmain();\\nIn ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can await promise. This is just \"sugar\" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the async and await keywords. Making the above example:awaitasyncawaitasync function foo(){\\n    var data = await fetch(\"/echo/json\"); // Notice the await\\n    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done\\n    return data.json(); // \\'data\\' is defined\\n}\\nIt still returns a promise just the same :)',\n",
              "   'You are using Ajax incorrectly.

              "   \"It's a very common issue we face while struggling with the 'mysteries' of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.Let's start with a simple JavaScript function:function foo(){\\n    // Do something\\n    return 'wohoo';\\n}\\n\\nlet bar = foo(); // 'bar' is 'wohoo' here\\nThat's a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is 'finished with its job' before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.Now let's add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not 'finished' in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:function foo(){\\n    setTimeout( ()=> {\\n        return 'wohoo';\\n   }, 1000)\\n}\\n\\nlet bar = foo() // 'bar' is undefined here\\nSo there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it's actually pretty logical if you look at the code.The function foo(), upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is undefined), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return 'wohoo'. But as you can see, the value that's assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just undefined.foo()undefinedundefinedSo, how do we tackle this issue?Let's ask our function for a promise.\\nPromise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let's see it in action for our little problem above:function foo(){\\n   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // I want foo() to PROMISE me something\\n    setTimeout ( function(){\\n      // Promise is RESOLVED, when the execution reaches this line of code\\n       resolve('wohoo') // After 1 second, RESOLVE the promise with value 'wohoo'\\n    }, 1000 )\\n  })\\n}\\n\\nlet bar;\\nfoo().then( res => {\\n    bar = res;\\n    console.log(bar) // Will print 'wohoo'\\n});\\nThus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.resolveApart from using then/catch to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to recognize an asynchronous function and then wait for the promises to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It's still just the promises under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:then/catchpromisesfunction saveUsers(){\\n     getUsers()\\n      .then(users => {\\n         saveSomewhere(users);\\n      })\\n      .catch(err => {\\n          console.error(err);\\n       })\\n }\\n  async function saveUsers(){\\n     try{\\n        let users = await getUsers()\\n        saveSomewhere(users);\\n     }\\n     catch(err){\\n        console.error(err);\\n     }\\n  }\\n\",\n",

              "   'JavaScript is single threaded.The browser can be divided into three parts:Event LoopWeb APIEvent QueueThe event loop runs for forever, i.e., kind of an infinite loop. The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn\\'t start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.That\\'s where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn\\'t any function left in our queue to utilise this data. Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.Thus the solution to this is callback or promise.one of the answers hereWe give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.function doAjax(callbackFunc, method, url) {\\n    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\\n    xmlHttpReq.open(method, url);\\n    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {\\n\\n        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200) {\\n            callbackFunc(xmlHttpReq.responseText);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    xmlHttpReq.send(null);\\n}\\nIn my code it is called as:function loadMyJson(categoryValue){\\n    if(categoryValue === \"veg\")\\n        doAjax(print, \"GET\", \"http://localhost:3004/vegetables\");\\n    else if(categoryValue === \"fruits\")\\n        doAjax(print, \"GET\", \"http://localhost:3004/fruits\");\\n    else\\n      console.log(\"Data not found\");\\n}\\nJavaScript.info callbackJavaScript.info callback',\n",

              "   'We find ourselves in a universe which appears to progress along a dimension we call \"time\". We don\\'t really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: \"past\", \"present\", \"future\", \"before\", \"after\".The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called \"asynchronicity\". In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can\\'t put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won\\'t work:var milk = order_milk();\\nput_in_coffee(milk);\\nBecause JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for order_milk to finish before it executes put_in_coffee. In other words, it does not know that order_milk is asynchronous--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.order_milkput_in_coffeeorder_milkThe classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the \"callback\" approach. It looks like this:order_milk(put_in_coffee);\\norder_milk kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes put_in_coffee.order_milkput_in_coffeeThe problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with return; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let\\'s say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:returnorder_milk(function(milk) { put_in_coffee(milk, drink_coffee); }\\nwhere I am passing to put_in_coffee both the milk to put in it, and also the action (drink_coffee) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.put_in_coffeedrink_coffeeIn this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:var answer;\\n$.ajax(\\'/foo.json\\') . done(function(response) {\\n  callback(response.data);\\n});\\n\\nfunction callback(data) {\\n  console.log(data);\\n}\\nThis was the motivation for the notion of a \"promise\", which is a particular type of value which represents a future or asynchronous outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named then, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.thenIn the case of our milk and coffee, we design order_milk to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify put_in_coffee as a then action, as follows:order_milkput_in_coffeethenorder_milk() . then(put_in_coffee)\\nOne advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences (\"chaining\"):order_milk() . then(put_in_coffee) . then(drink_coffee)\\nLet\\'s apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:function get_data() {\\n  return $.ajax(\\'/foo.json\\');\\n}\\nActually, all we\\'ve done is added a return to the call to $.ajax. This works because jQuery\\'s $.ajax already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to $.ajax that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply sayreturn$.ajax$.ajax$.ajaxget_data() . then(do_something)\\nfor instance,get_data() .\\n  then(function(data) { console.log(data); });\\nWhen using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into then, so it\\'s often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:thenget_data() .\\n  then(data => console.log(data));\\nasyncBut there\\'s still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we writea();\\nb();\\nbut if a is asynchronous, with promises we have to writeaa() . then(b);\\nAbove, we said, \"JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for the first call to finish before it executes the second\". Wouldn\\'t it be nice if there was some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the await keyword, used inside a special type of function called an \"async\" function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as Babel given the right presets. This allows us to simply writeawaitBabelasync function morning_routine() {\\n  var milk   = await order_milk();\\n  var coffee = await put_in_coffee(milk);\\n  await drink(coffee);\\n}\\nIn your case, you would be able to write something likeasync function foo() {\\n  data = await get_data();\\n  console.log(data);\\n}\\n',\n",

              "   'Rather than throwing code at you, there are two concepts that are key to understanding how JavaScript handles callbacks and asynchronicity (is that even a word?)The Event Loop and Concurrency ModelThere are three things you need to be aware of; The queue; the event loop and the stackthe event loopIn broad, simplistic terms, the event loop is like the project manager, it is constantly listening for any functions that want to run and communicates between the queue and the stack.while (queue.waitForMessage()) {\\n  queue.processNextMessage();\\n}\\nOnce it receives a message to run something it adds it to the queue. The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it\\'s being told to call foobarFuncfoobarFuncfunction foobarFunc (var) {\\n  console.log(anotherFunction(var));\\n}\\nSo anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case anotherFunction) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)anotherFunctionThe key thing here is the order of execution. That isWhen you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don\\'t know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say \"hey run me\". If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.That\\'s why with asynchronous functionality we use things called callbacks. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A promise uses callbacks (functions passed to .then() for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying \"I promise to return something at some point\" and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called deffered.done deffered.fail and deffered.always (amongst others). You can see them all herepromise.then()deffered.donedeffered.faildeffered.alwayshereSo what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.Because a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it\\'s important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. sofunction foo(bla) {\\n  console.log(bla)\\n}\\nso most of the time (but not always) you\\'ll pass foo not foo()foofoo()Hopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer.'],\n",

For simplicity,\\nAndroid groups all actual screen densities into four generalized\\ndensities: low, medium, high, and extra high.Orientation:The orientation of the screen from the user\\'s point of view.

Be aware\\nthat not only do different devices operate in different orientations\\nby default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user\\nrotates the device.Resolution:The total number of physical pixels on a screen.

              "   \"The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as pixels (px). A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.Density independent pixel (dp or dip) allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpiwhere,dpi is dots per inchSo, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.Formulapx/dp = dpi/160dpiDots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)Scale independent pixels(sp) is the preferred unit for font size.\\nFor accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%.

It\\'s because git rebase with no arguments enables the --fork-point option by default, which uses the local reflog to try to be robust against the upstream branch being force-pushed.git rebasegit rebase--fork-pointSuppose you branched off origin/master when it contained commits M1, M2, M3, then made three commits yourself:M1--M2--M3  <-- origin/master\\n         \\\\\\n          T1--T2--T3  <-- topic\\nbut then someone rewrites history by force-pushing origin/master to remove M2:M1--M3\\'  <-- origin/master\\n \\\\\\n  M2--M3--T1--T2--T3  <-- topic\\nUsing your local reflog, git rebase can see that you forked from an earlier incarnation of the origin/master branch, and hence that the M2 and M3 commits are not really part of your topic branch. Hence it reasonably assumes that since M2 was removed from the upstream branch, you no longer want it in your topic branch either once the topic branch is rebased:git rebaseM1--M3\\'  <-- origin/master\\n     \\\\\\n      T1\\'--T2\\'--T3\\'  <-- topic (rebased)\\nThis behavior makes sense, and is generally the right thing to do when rebasing.So the reason that the following commands fail:git branch -t newbranch\\ngit reset --hard HEAD~3\\ngit checkout newbranch\\nis because they leave the reflog in the wrong state. Git sees newbranch as having forked off the upstream branch at a revision that includes the 3 commits, then the reset --hard rewrites the upstream\\'s history to remove the commits, and so next time you run git rebase it discards them like any other commit that has been removed from the upstream.newbranchreset --hardgit rebaseBut in this particular case we want those 3 commits to be considered as part of the topic branch. To achieve that, we need to fork off the upstream at the earlier revision that doesn\\'t include the 3 commits.

By definition, a PUT is idempotent.  Do it as many times as you like, and the result is the same. x=5 is idempotent.  You can PUT a resource whether it previously exists, or not (eg, to Create, or to Update)! x=5POST updates a resource, adds a subsidiary resource, or causes a change.  A POST is not idempotent, in the way that x++ is not idempotent. x++By this argument, PUT is for creating when you know the URL of the thing you will create.

Eg. /blogs/nigel/entry/when_to_use_post_vs_put as the title is used as the resource key/blogs/nigel/entry/when_to_use_post_vs_putPUT replaces the resource at the known url if it already exists, so sending the same request twice has no effect. In other words, calls to PUT are idempotent.The RFC reads like this:The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI,Note: PUT has mostly been used to update resources (by replacing them in their entireties), but recently there is movement towards using PATCH for updating existing resources, as PUT specifies that it replaces the whole resource.

While it came out of the blogging community, it is in no way restricted to blogging: it is a generic protocol for RESTfully interacting with arbitrary (nested) collections of arbitrary resources via HTTP.

              "   'The decision of whether to use PUT or POST to create a resource on a server with an HTTP + REST API is based on who owns the URL structure. Having the client know, or participate in defining, the URL struct is an unnecessary coupling akin to the undesirable couplings that arose from SOA. Escaping types of couplings is the reason REST is so popular. Therefore, the proper method to use is POST. There are exceptions to this rule and they occur when the client wishes to retain control over the location structure of the resources it deploys. This is rare and likely means something else is wrong.At this point some people will argue that if RESTful-URL\\'s are used, the client does knows the URL of the resource and therefore a PUT is acceptable. After all, this is why canonical, normalized, Ruby on Rails, Django URLs are important, look at the Twitter API … blah blah blah. Those people need to understand there is no such thing as a Restful-URL and that Roy Fielding himself states that:A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an\\nobvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom\\nto control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct\\nclients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML\\nforms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media\\ntypes and link relations. [Failure here implies that clients are\\nassuming a resource structure due to out-of band information, such as\\na domain-specific standard, which is the data-oriented equivalent to\\nRPC\\'s functional coupling].http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-drivenhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-drivenThe idea of a RESTful-URL is actually a violation of REST as the server is in charge of the URL structure and should be free to decide how to use it to avoid coupling. If this confuses you read about the significance of self discovery on API design.Using POST to create resources comes with a design consideration because POST is not idempotent. This means that repeating a POST several times does not guarantee the same behavior each time. This scares people into using PUT to create resources when they should not. They know it\\'s wrong (POST is for CREATE) but they do it anyway because they don\\'t know how to solve this problem.  This concern is demonstrated in the following situation:Step 6 is where people commonly get confused about what to do. However, there is no reason to create a kludge to solve this issue. Instead, HTTP can be used as specified in RFC 2616 and the server replies:RFC 261610.4.10 409 ConflictThe request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current\\nstate of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where\\nit is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and\\nresubmit the request.

For\\nexample, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT\\nincluded changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an\\nearlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response\\nto indicate that it can’t complete the request. In this case, the\\nresponse entity would likely contain a list of the differences between\\nthe two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.Replying with a status code of 409 Conflict is the correct recourse because:Update based on release of RFC 7231 to Replace 2616RFC 7231 is designed to replace 2616 and in Section 4.3.3 describes the follow possible response for a POSTRFC 7231Section 4.3.3If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a\\nrepresentation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect\\nthe user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response\\nwith the existing resource\\'s identifier in the Location field.

An example would be a \"thank you for submitting your request message\" that the client need not re-download each time.

              "   'Readers new to this topic will be struck by the endless discussion about what you should do, and the relative absence of lessons from experience. The fact that REST is \"preferred\" over SOAP is, I suppose, a high-level learning from experience, but goodness we must have progressed from there? It\\'s 2016. Roy\\'s dissertation was in 2000. What have we developed? Was it fun? Was it easy to integrate with? To support? Will it handle the rise of smartphones and flaky mobile connections?According to ME, real-life networks are unreliable. Requests timeout. Connections are reset. Networks go down for hours or days at a time. Trains go into tunnels with mobile users aboard. For any given request (as occasionally acknowledged in all this discussion) the request can fall in the water on its way, or the response can fall in the water on its way back. In these conditions, issuing PUT, POST and DELETE requests directly against substantive resources has always struck me as a little brutal and naive.HTTP does nothing to ensure reliable completion of the request-response, and that\\'s just fine because this is properly the job of network-aware applications. Developing such an application, you can jump through hoops to use PUT instead of POST, then more hoops to give a certain kind of error on the server if you detect duplicate requests. Back at the client, you then have to jump through hoops to interpret these errors, refetch, revalidate and repost.Or you can do this: consider your unsafe requests as ephemeral single-user resources (let\\'s call them actions). Clients request a new \"action\" on a substantive resource with an empty POST to the resource. POST will be used only for this. Once safely in possession of the URI of the freshly minted action, the client PUTs the unsafe request to the action URI, not the target resource. Resolving the action and updating the \"real\" resource is properly the job of your API, and is here decoupled from the unreliable network.The server does the business, returns the response and stores it against the agreed action URI. If anything goes wrong, the client repeats the request (natural behaviour!), and if the server has already seen it, it repeats the stored response and does nothing else.You will quickly spot the similarity with promises: we create and return the placeholder for the result before doing anything. Also like a promise, an action can succeed or fail one time, but its result can be fetched repeatedly.Best of all, we give sending and receiving applications a chance to link the uniquely identified action to uniqueness in their respective environments. And we can start to demand, and enforce!, responsible behaviour from clients: repeat your requests as much as you like, but don\\'t go generating a new action until you\\'re in possession of a definitive result from the existing one.As such, numerous thorny problems go away. Repeated insert requests won\\'t create duplicates, and we don\\'t create the real resource until we\\'re in possession of the data. (database columns can stay not-nullable). Repeated update requests won\\'t hit incompatible states and won\\'t overwrite subsequent changes. Clients can (re)fetch and seamlessy process the original confirmation for whatever reason (client crashed, response went missing, etc.).Successive delete requests can see and process the original confirmation, without hitting a 404 error. If things take longer than expected, we can respond provisionally, and we have a place where the client can check back for the definitive result. The nicest part of this pattern is its Kung-Fu (Panda) property. We take a weakness, the propensity for clients to repeat a request any time they don\\'t understand the response, and turn it into a strength :-)Before telling me this is not RESTful, please consider the numerous ways in which REST principles are respected. Clients don\\'t construct URLs. The API stays discoverable, albeit with a little change in semantics. HTTP verbs are used appropriately. If you think this is a huge change to implement, I can tell you from experience that it\\'s not.If you think you\\'ll have huge amounts of data to store, let\\'s talk volumes: a typical update confirmation is a fraction of a kilobyte. HTTP currently gives you a minute or two to respond definitively. Even if you only store actions for a week, clients have ample chance to catch up. If you have very high volumes, you may want a dedicated acid-compliant key value store, or an in-memory solution. ',\n",
              "   'There seems to always be some confusion as to when to use the HTTP POST versus the HTTP PUT method for REST services. Most developers will try to associate CRUD operations directly to HTTP methods. I will argue that this is not correct and one can not simply associate the CRUD concepts to the HTTP methods. That is:Create => HTTP PUT\\nRetrieve => HTTP GET\\nUpdate => HTTP POST\\nDelete => HTTP DELETE\\nIt is true that the R(etrieve) and D(elete) of the CRUD operations can be mapped directly to the HTTP methods GET and DELETE respectively. However, the confusion lies in the C(reate) and U(update) operations. In some cases, one can use the PUT for a create while in other cases a POST will be required. The ambiguity lies in the definition of an HTTP PUT method versus an HTTP POST method.According to the HTTP 1.1 specifications the GET, HEAD, DELETE, and PUT methods must be idempotent, and the POST method is not idempotent. That is to say that an operation is idempotent if it can be performed on a resource once or many times and always return the same state of that resource. Whereas a non idempotent operation can return a modified state of the resource from one request to another. Hence, in a non idempotent operation, there is no guarantee that one will receive the same state of a resource.Based on the above idempotent definition, my take on using the HTTP PUT method versus using the HTTP POST method for REST services is:\\nUse the HTTP PUT method when:The client includes all aspect of the resource including the unique identifier to uniquely identify the resource. Example: creating a new employee.\\nThe client provides all the information for a resource to be able to modify that resource.This implies that the server side does not update any aspect of the resource (such as an update date).\\nIn both cases, these operations can be performed multiple times with the same results. That is the resource will not be changed by requesting the operation more than once. Hence, a true idempotent operation.\\nUse the HTTP POST method when:The server will provide some information concerning the newly created resource. For example, take a logging system. A new entry in the log will most likely have a numbering scheme which is determined on the server side. Upon creating a new log entry, the new sequence number will be determined by the server and not by the client.\\nOn a modification of a resource, the server will provide such information as a resource state or an update date. Again in this case not all information was provided by the client and the resource will be changing from one modification request to the next. Hence a non idempotent operation.\\nConclusionDo not directly correlate and map CRUD operations to HTTP methods for REST services. The use of an HTTP PUT method versus an HTTP POST method should be based on the idempotent aspect of that operation. That is, if the operation is idempotent, then use the HTTP PUT method. If the operation is non idempotent, then use the HTTP POST method.',\n",

If the message can be interpreted as adding a resource to a directory, that would be OK, but basically you need to understand the message you are sending (posting) to know what will happen with the resource.Because PUT and GET and DELETE refer to a resource, they are also by definition idempotent.POST can perform the other three functions, but then the semantics of the request will be lost on the intermediaries such as caches and proxies. This also applies to providing security on the resource, since a post's URI doesn't necessarily indicate the resource it is applying to (it can though).A PUT doesn't need to be a create; the service could error if the resource isn't already created, but otherwise update it. Or vice versa -- it may create the resource, but not allow updates. The only thing required about PUT is that it points to a specific resource, and its payload is the representation of that resource. A successful PUT means (barring interference) that a GET would retrieve the same resource.Edit: One more thing -- a PUT can create, but if it does then the ID has to be a natural ID -- AKA an email address. That way when you PUT twice, the second put is an update of the first. This makes it idempotent.If the ID is generated (a new employee ID, for example), then the second PUT with the same URL would create a new record, which violates the idempotent rule. In this case the verb would be POST, and the message (not resource) would be to create a resource using the values defined in this message.\",\n",
              "   'Here\\'s a simple rule:PUT to a URL should be used to update or create the resource that can be located at that URL.POST to a URL should be used to update or create a resource which is located at some other (\"subordinate\") URL, or is not locatable via HTTP.',\n",
              "   'The semantics are supposed be different, in that \"PUT\", like \"GET\" is supposed to be idempotent -- meaning, you can the same exact PUT request multiple times and the result will be as if you executed it only once. I will describe the conventions which I think are most widely used and are most useful:When you PUT a resource at a particular URL what happens is that it should get saved at that URL, or something along those lines.When you POST to a resource at a particular URL, often you are posting a related piece of information to that URL. This implies that the resource at the URL already exists.For example, when you want to create a new stream, you can PUT it to some URL. But when you want to POST a message to an existing stream, you POST to its URL.As for modifying the properties of the stream, you can do that with either PUT or POST. Basically, only use \"PUT\" when the operation is idempotent - otherwise use POST.Note, however, that not all modern browsers support HTTP verbs other than GET or POST.',\n",
              "   'Most of the time, you will use them like this:For example:In both cases, the request body contains the data for the resource to be created or updated. It should be obvious from the route names that POST is not idempotent (if you call it 3 times it will create 3 objects), but PUT is idempotent (if you call it 3 times the result is the same). PUT is often used for \"upsert\" operation (create or update), but you can always return a 404 error if you only want to use it to modify.Note that POST \"creates\" a new element in the collection, and PUT \"replaces\" an element at a given URL, but it is a very common practice to use PUT for partial modifications, that is, use it only to update existing resources and only modify the included fields in the body (ignoring the other fields). This is technically incorrect, if you want to be REST-purist, PUT should replace the whole resource and you should use PATCH for the partial update. I personally don\\'t care much as far as the behavior is clear and consistent across all your API endpoints.Remember, REST is a set of conventions and guidelines to keep your API simple. If you end up with a complicated work-around just to check the \"RESTfull\" box then you are defeating the purpose ;)',\n",

              "   \"PUTPOSTThe latest authoritative description of the semantic difference between the POST and PUT request methods is given in RFC 9110 (Roy Fielding, Mark Nottingham, Julian Reschke, 2022):POSTPUTRFC 9110The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT methods is highlighted by the different intent for the enclosed representation. The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics, whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as replacing the state of the target resource. Hence, the intent of PUT is idempotent and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server.POSTPUTPOSTPUTPUTIn other words, the intended effect of PUT is standardized (create or replace the state of the target resource with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request) and so is generic to all target resources, while the intended effect of POST is not standardized and so is specific to each target resource. Thus POST can be used for anything, including for achieving the intended effects of PUT and other request methods (GET, HEAD, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE).PUTPOSTPOSTPUTGETHEADDELETECONNECTOPTIONSTRACEBut it is recommended to always use the more specialized request method rather than POST when applicable because it provides more information to intermediaries for automating information retrieval (since GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as safe), handling communication failure (since GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as idempotent), and optimizing cache performance (since GET and HEAD are defined as cacheable), as explained in It Is Okay to Use POST (Roy Fielding, 2009):POSTGETHEADOPTIONSTRACEGETHEADPUTDELETEOPTIONSTRACEGETHEADIt Is Okay to Use POSTPOST only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which some other method is ideally suited: e.g., retrieval of information that should be a representation of some resource (GET), complete replacement of a representation (PUT), or any of the other standardized methods that tell intermediaries something more valuable than “this may change something.” The other methods are more valuable to intermediaries because they say something about how failures can be automatically handled and how intermediate caches can optimize their behavior. POST does not have those characteristics, but that doesn’t mean we can live without it. POST serves many useful purposes in HTTP, including the general purpose of “this action isn’t worth standardizing.”POSTGETPUTPOSTPOST\"],\n",

This is the most straightforward way, but it is limited to your domain because of the JavaScript sandbox security model. Using eval also opens the door to bugs, hacks and security issues.evalevalLike Dynamic Imports you can load one or many scripts with a fetch call using promises to control order of execution for script dependencies using the Fetch Inject library:fetchFetch InjectfetchInject([\\n  \\'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.17.1/moment.min.js\\'\\n]).then(() => {\\n  console.log(`Finish in less than ${moment().endOf(\\'year\\').fromNow(true)}`)\\n})\\nThe jQuery library provides loading functionality in one line:jQueryin one line$.getScript(\"my_lovely_script.js\", function() {\\n   alert(\"Script loaded but not necessarily executed.\");\\n});\\nYou could add a script tag with the script URL into the HTML. To avoid the overhead of jQuery, this is an ideal solution.The script can even reside on a different server. Furthermore, the browser evaluates the code. The <script> tag can be injected into either the web page <head>, or inserted just before the closing </body> tag.<script><head></body>Here is an example of how this could work:function dynamicallyLoadScript(url) {\\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");  // create a script DOM node\\n    script.src = url;  // set its src to the provided URL\\n   \\n    document.head.appendChild(script);  // add it to the end of the head section of the page (could change \\'head\\' to \\'body\\' to add it to the end of the body section instead)\\n}\\nThis function will add a new <script> tag to the end of the head section of the page, where the src attribute is set to the URL which is given to the function as the first parameter.<script>srcBoth of these solutions are discussed and illustrated in JavaScript Madness: Dynamic Script Loading.JavaScript Madness: Dynamic Script LoadingNow, there is a big issue you must know about. Doing that implies that you remotely load the code. Modern web browsers will load the file and keep executing your current script because they load everything asynchronously to improve performance. (This applies to both the jQuery method and the manual dynamic script loading method.)It means that if you use these tricks directly, you won\\'t be able to use your newly loaded code the next line after you asked it to be loaded, because it will be still loading.For example: my_lovely_script.js contains MySuperObject:my_lovely_script.jsMySuperObjectvar js = document.createElement(\"script\");\\n\\njs.type = \"text/javascript\";\\njs.src = jsFilePath;\\n\\ndocument.body.appendChild(js);\\n\\nvar s = new MySuperObject();\\n\\nError : MySuperObject is undefined\\nThen you reload the page hitting F5. And it works! Confusing...So what to do about it ?Well, you can use the hack the author suggests in the link I gave you. In summary, for people in a hurry, he uses an event to run a callback function when the script is loaded. So you can put all the code using the remote library in the callback function. For example:function loadScript(url, callback)\\n{\\n    // Adding the script tag to the head as suggested before\\n    var head = document.head;\\n    var script = document.createElement(\\'script\\');\\n    script.type = \\'text/javascript\\';\\n    script.src = url;\\n\\n    // Then bind the event to the callback function.\\n    // There are several events for cross browser compatibility.\\n    script.onreadystatechange = callback;\\n    script.onload = callback;\\n\\n    // Fire the loading\\n    head.appendChild(script);\\n}\\nThen you write the code you want to use AFTER the script is loaded in a lambda function:lambda functionvar myPrettyCode = function() {\\n   // Here, do whatever you want\\n};\\nThen you run all that:loadScript(\"my_lovely_script.js\", myPrettyCode);\\nNote that the script may execute after the DOM has loaded, or before, depending on the browser and whether you included the line script.async = false;. There\\'s a great article on Javascript loading in general which discusses this.script.async = false;great article on Javascript loading in generalAs mentioned at the top of this answer, many developers use build/transpilation tool(s) like Parcel, Webpack, or Babel in their projects, allowing them to use upcoming JavaScript syntax, provide backward compatibility for older browsers, combine files, minify, perform code splitting etc.',\n",

              "   'There actually is a way to load a JavaScript file not asynchronously, so you could use the functions included in your newly loaded file right after loading it, and I think it works in all browsers.You need to use jQuery.append() on the <head> element of your page, that is:jQuery.append()<head>$(\"head\").append($(\"<script></script>\").attr(\"src\", url));\\n\\n/* Note that following line of code is incorrect because it doesn\\'t escape the\\n * HTML attribute src correctly and will fail if `url` contains special characters:\\n * $(\"head\").append(\\'<script src=\"\\' + url + \\'\"></script>\\');\\n */\\nHowever, this method also has a problem: if an error happens in the imported JavaScript file, Firebug (and also Firefox Error Console and Chrome Developer Tools as well) will report its place incorrectly, which is a big problem if you use Firebug to track JavaScript errors down a lot (I do).

              "   \"There are several ways to implement modules in JavaScript. Here are the two most popular ones:Browsers do not support this moduling system yet, so in order for you to use this syntax you must use a bundler like Webpack. Using a bundler is better anyway because this can combine all of your different files into a single (or a couple of related) files. This will serve the files from the server to the client faster because each HTTP request has some associated overhead accompanied with it. Thus by reducing the overall HTTP request we improve the performance. Here is an example of ES6 modules:Webpack// main.js file\\n\\nexport function add (a, b) {\\n  return a + b;\\n}\\n\\nexport default function multiply (a, b) {\\n  return a * b;\\n}\\n\\n\\n// test.js file\\n\\nimport {add}, multiply from './main';   // For named exports between curly braces {export1, export2}\\n                                        // For default exports without {}\\n\\nconsole.log(multiply(2, 2));  // logs 4\\n\\nconsole.log(add(1, 2));  // logs 3\\nThis moduling system is used in Node.js. You basically add your exports to an object which is called module.exports. You then can access this object via a require('modulePath'). Important here is to realize that these modules are being cached, so if you require() a certain module twice it will return the already created module.module.exportsrequire('modulePath')require()// main.js file\\n\\nfunction add (a, b) {\\n  return a + b;\\n}\\n\\nmodule.exports = add;  // Here we add our 'add' function to the exports object\\n\\n\\n// test.js file\\n\\nconst add = require('./main');\\n\\nconsole.log(add(1,2));  // logs 3\\n\"],\n",

Variables declared by var keyword are scoped to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) while let variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by { } (hence the block scope).varlet{ }function run() {\\n  var foo = \"Foo\";\\n  let bar = \"Bar\";\\n\\n  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar\\n\\n  {\\n    var moo = \"Mooo\"\\n    let baz = \"Bazz\";\\n    console.log(moo, baz); // Mooo Bazz\\n  }\\n\\n  console.log(moo); // Mooo\\n  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError\\n}\\n\\nrun();The reason why let keyword was introduced to the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.letTake a look at this example from another Stack Overflow question:another Stack Overflow questionvar funcs = [];\\n// let\\'s create 3 functions\\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\\n  // and store them in funcs\\n  funcs[i] = function() {\\n    // each should log its value.\\n    console.log(\"My value: \" + i);\\n  };\\n}\\nfor (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\\n  // and now let\\'s run each one to see\\n  funcs[j]();\\n}My value: 3 was output to console each time funcs[j](); was invoked since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.My value: 3funcs[j]();People had to create immediately invoked functions to capture correct values from the loops but that was also hairy.While variables declared with var keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which means they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:varhoistedundefinedfunction run() {\\n  console.log(foo); // undefined\\n  var foo = \"Foo\";\\n  console.log(foo); // Foo\\n}\\n\\nrun();let variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization results in a ReferenceError. The variable is said to be in \"temporal dead zone\" from the start of the block until the initialization is processed.letReferenceErrorfunction checkHoisting() {\\n  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError\\n  let foo = \"Foo\";\\n  console.log(foo); // Foo\\n}\\n\\ncheckHoisting();At the top level, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object:letvarvar foo = \"Foo\";  // globally scoped\\nlet bar = \"Bar\"; // not allowed to be globally scoped\\n\\nconsole.log(window.foo); // Foo\\nconsole.log(window.bar); // undefinedIn strict mode, var will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope while let raises a SyntaxError.varlet\\'use strict\\';\\nvar foo = \"foo1\";\\nvar foo = \"foo2\"; // No problem, \\'foo1\\' is replaced with \\'foo2\\'.\\n\\nlet bar = \"bar1\"; \\nlet bar = \"bar2\"; // SyntaxError: Identifier \\'bar\\' has already been declared',\n",

Yet, our variable i is known in the entire function.jiAlso, consider that block scoped variables are not known before they are declared because they are not hoisted. You're also not allowed to redeclare the same block scoped variable within the same block. This makes block scoped variables less error prone than globally or functionally scoped variables, which are hoisted and which do not produce any errors in case of multiple declarations.letSome people would argue that in the future we'll ONLY use let statements and that var statements will become obsolete.

From the documentation in MDN (examples also from MDN):MDNlet allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.Variables declared by let have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function:function varTest() {\\n  var x = 1;\\n  if (true) {\\n    var x = 2;  // same variable!\\n    console.log(x);  // 2\\n  }\\n  console.log(x);  // 2\\n}\\n\\nfunction letTest() {\\n  let x = 1;\\n  if (true) {\\n    let x = 2;  // different variable\\n    console.log(x);  // 2\\n  }\\n  console.log(x);  // 1\\n}`\\nAt the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object. For example:var x = \\'global\\';\\nlet y = \\'global\\';\\nconsole.log(this.x); // \"global\"\\nconsole.log(this.y); // undefined\\nWhen used inside a block, let limits the variable\\'s scope to that block.

Instead, at the end of the loop, the i in each function\\'s closure refers to i\\'s value at the end of the loop (1000) for every anonymous function in adderFunctions. This isn\\'t what we wanted at all: we now have an array of 1000 different functions in memory with exactly the same behavior.

An example is the best way to illustrate this behavior:varletletvariables with let don't get hoisted:letconsole.log(letVar);\\n\\nlet letVar = 10;\\n// referenceError, the variable doesn't get hoisted\\nvariables with var do get hoisted:varconsole.log(varVar);\\n\\nvar varVar = 10;\\n// logs undefined, the variable gets hoisted\\nletwindowA variable declared with let in the global scope (which is code that is not in a function) doesn't get added as a property on the global window object. For example (this code is in global scope):letwindowvar bar = 5;\\nlet foo  = 10;\\n\\nconsole.log(bar); // logs 5\\nconsole.log(foo); // logs 10\\n\\nconsole.log(window.bar);  \\n// logs 5, variable added to window object\\n\\nconsole.log(window.foo);\\n// logs undefined, variable not added to window object\\nWhen should let be used over var?letvarUse let over var whenever you can because it is simply scoped more specific. This reduces potential naming conflicts which can occur when dealing with a large number of variables. var can be used when you want a global variable explicitly to be on the window object (always consider carefully if this is really necessary). letvarvarwindow\",\n",
              "   'This explanation is taken from an article I wrote at Medium:MediumHoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function\\ndeclarations are moved to the top of their scope by the parser which\\nreads the source code into an intermediate representation before the\\nactual code execution starts by the JavaScript interpreter. So, it actually\\ndoesn’t matter where variables or functions are declared, they will be\\nmoved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is\\nglobal or local. This means thatconsole.log (hi);     \\nvar hi = \"say hi\";\\nis actually interpreted tovar hi = undefined;\\nconsole.log (hi);\\nhi = \"say hi\";\\nSo, as we saw just now, var variables are being hoisted to the top\\nof their scope and are being initialized with the value of undefined\\nwhich means that we can actually assign their value before actually\\ndeclaring them in the code like so:varhi = “say hi”\\nconsole.log (hi); // say hi\\nvar hi;\\nRegarding function declarations, we can invoke them before actually declaring them like so:sayHi(); // Hi\\n\\nfunction sayHi() {\\n   console.log(\\'Hi\\');\\n};\\nFunction expressions, on the other hand, are not hoisted, so we’ll get the following error:sayHi(); //Output: \"TypeError: sayHi is not a function\\n\\nvar sayHi = function() {\\n  console.log(\\'Hi\\');\\n}; \\nES6 introduced JavaScript developers the let and const keywords. While let and const are block-scoped and not function\\nscoped as var it shouldn’t make a difference while discussing their\\nhoisting behavior. We’ll start from the end, JavaScript hoists let\\nand const.letconstletconstvarletconstconsole.log(hi); // Output: Cannot access \\'hi\\' before initialization \\nlet hi = \\'Hi\\';\\nAs we can see above, let doesn’t allow us to use undeclared\\nvariables, hence the interpreter explicitly output a reference error\\nindicating that the hi variable cannot be accessed before\\ninitialization. The same error will occur if we change the above let\\nto constlethiletconstconsole.log(hi); // Output: Cannot access \\'hi\\' before initialization\\nconst hi = \\'Hi\\';\\nSo, bottom line, the JavaScript parser searches for variable\\ndeclarations and functions and hoists them to the top of their scope\\nbefore code execution and assign values to them in the memory so in\\ncase the interpreter will encounter them while executing the code he\\nwill recognize them and will be able to execute the code with their\\nassigned values. Variables declared with let or const remain\\nuninitialized at the beginning of execution while that variables\\ndeclared with var are being initialized with a value of undefined.letconstvarundefinedI added this visual illustration to better help understanding of how are the hoisted\\nvariables and function are being saved in the memory ',\n",

Because readlink adds a newline of its own (which would normally be eaten in the command substitution if not for our previous trickery), we have to get rid of that, too.

              "   'Here is a summary of ways to call external programs, including their advantages and disadvantages:os.system passes the command and arguments to your system\\'s shell. This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection. For example:os.systemos.systemos.system(\"some_command < input_file | another_command > output_file\")  \\nHowever, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, et cetera. On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.os.popen will do the same thing as os.system except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process. There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently. If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don\\'t need to worry about escaping anything. Example:os.popenos.popenos.systemprint(os.popen(\"ls -l\").read())\\nsubprocess.Popen. This is intended as a replacement for os.popen, but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive. For example, you\\'d say:subprocess.Popensubprocess.Popenos.popenprint subprocess.Popen(\"echo Hello World\", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()\\ninstead ofprint os.popen(\"echo Hello World\").read()\\nbut it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions. See the documentation.the documentationsubprocess.call. This is basically just like the Popen class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code. For example:subprocess.callsubprocess.callPopenreturn_code = subprocess.call(\"echo Hello World\", shell=True)\\nsubprocess.run. Python 3.5+ only. Similar to the above but even more flexible and returns a CompletedProcess object when the command finishes executing.subprocess.runsubprocess.runCompletedProcessCompletedProcessos.fork, os.exec, os.spawn are similar to their C language counterparts, but I don\\'t recommend using them directly.os.forkos.execos.spawnThe subprocess module should probably be what you use.subprocessFinally, please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. There are serious security implications if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:print subprocess.Popen(\"echo %s \" % user_input, stdout=PIPE).stdout.read()\\nand imagine that the user enters something \"my mama didnt love me && rm -rf /\" which could erase the whole filesystem.my mama didnt love me && rm -rf /',\n",

But it is not clear what happens after the line \\'some more code here\\' from the example.My target platform was FreeBSD, but the development was on Windows, so I faced the problem on Windows first.On Windows (Windows\\xa0XP), the parent process will not finish until the longtask.py has finished its work. It is not what you want in a CGI script. The problem is not specific to Python; in the PHP community the problems are the same.The solution is to pass DETACHED_PROCESS Process Creation Flag to the underlying CreateProcess function in Windows API.\\nIf you happen to have installed pywin32, you can import the flag from the win32process module, otherwise you should define it yourself:Process Creation FlagDETACHED_PROCESS = 0x00000008\\n\\npid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, \"longtask.py\"],\\n                       creationflags=DETACHED_PROCESS).pid\\n/* UPD 2015.10.27 @eryksun in a comment below notes, that the semantically correct flag is CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE (0x00000010) */On FreeBSD we have another problem: when the parent process is finished, it finishes the child processes as well. And that is not what you want in a CGI script either. Some experiments showed that the problem seemed to be in sharing sys.stdout. And the working solution was the following:pid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, \"longtask.py\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\\nI have not checked the code on other platforms and do not know the reasons of the behaviour on FreeBSD.

The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. Both are equally quick.========falseTo quote Douglas Crockford\\'s excellent JavaScript: The Good Parts,JavaScript: The Good PartsJavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces true and !== produces false.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  The rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:===!====!====true!==false\\'\\' == \\'0\\'           // false\\n0 == \\'\\'             // true\\n0 == \\'0\\'            // true\\nfalse == \\'false\\'    // false\\nfalse == \\'0\\'        // true\\nfalse == undefined  // false\\nfalse == null       // false\\nnull == undefined   // true\\n\\' \\\\t\\\\r\\\\n \\' == 0     // true\\nThe lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use === and !==.  All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.===!==false===A good point was brought up by @Casebash in the comments and in @Phillipe Laybaert\\'s answer concerning objects.  For objects, == and === act consistently with one another (except in a special case).@Casebash@Phillipe Laybaert\\'sanswer=====var a = [1,2,3];\\nvar b = [1,2,3];\\n\\nvar c = { x: 1, y: 2 };\\nvar d = { x: 1, y: 2 };\\n\\nvar e = \"text\";\\nvar f = \"te\" + \"xt\";\\n\\na == b            // false\\na === b           // false\\n\\nc == d            // false\\nc === d           // false\\n\\ne == f            // true\\ne === f           // true\\nThe special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its toString or valueOf method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the String constructor.toStringvalueOfString\"abc\" == new String(\"abc\")    // true\\n\"abc\" === new String(\"abc\")   // false\\nHere the == operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning true, but the === is seeing that they\\'re not the same type and returning false.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you\\'re trying to compare.

              "   'Let me add this counsel:If in doubt, read the specification!specificationECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why new String(\"a\") !== \"a\".Please let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let\\'s continue.Searching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: 11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === ), and after wading through the specificationalese I find:11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm\\nThe comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. Such a comparison is performed as follows:\\n\\xa0\\xa01. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa02. If Type(x) is Undefined, return true.\\n\\xa0\\xa03. If Type(x) is Null, return true.\\n\\xa0\\xa04. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.\\n\\xa0\\xa05. If x is NaN, return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa06. If y is NaN, return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa07. If x is the same number value as y, return true.\\n\\xa0\\xa08. If x is +0 and y is −0, return true.\\n\\xa0\\xa09. If x is −0 and y is +0, return true.\\n\\xa0\\xa010. Return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa011. If Type(x) is String, then return true if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa012. If Type(x) is Boolean, return true if x and y are both true or both false; otherwise, return false.\\n\\xa0\\xa013. Return true if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return false.Interesting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why new String(\"a\") !== \"a\". Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?Not so fast!Let\\'s check the types of the operands. Try it out for yourself by wrapping them in typeof(). I find that new String(\"a\") is an object, and step 1 is used: return false if the types are different.If you wonder why new String(\"a\") does not return a string, how about some exercise reading a specification? Have fun!Aidiakapi wrote this in a comment below:From the specification11.2.2 The new Operator:If Type(constructor) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.With other words, if String wouldn\\'t be of type Object it couldn\\'t be used with the new operator.new always returns an Object, even for String constructors, too.

Servers MUST be able to handle\\nthe URI of any resource they    serve,\\nand SHOULD be able to handle URIs of\\nunbounded length if they    provide\\nGET-based forms that could generate\\nsuch URIs. A server    SHOULD return\\n414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a\\nURI is longer    than the server can\\nhandle (see section 10.4.15).That RFC has been obsoleted by RFC7230 which is a refresh of the HTTP/1.1 specification. It contains similar language, but also goes on to suggest this:RFC7230Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in\\npractice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients\\nsupport, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.That's what the standards say. For the reality, there was an article on boutell.com (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:boutell.comExtremely long URLs are usually a\\nmistake. URLs over 2,000 characters\\nwill not work in the most popular web\\nbrowsers. Don't use them if you intend\\nyour site to work for the majority of\\nInternet users.(Note: this is a quote from an article written in 2006, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs do work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars, and it seems IE9 has a similar limit.IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 charsIE9 has a similar limitI've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can click a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.There's a nice writeup on the IE Internals blog which goes into some of the background to this.nice writeup on the IE Internals blogThere are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you! (see Calin-Andrei Burloiu's answer below)sitemaps protocolCalin-Andrei Burloiu's answerThere's also some research from 2010 into the maximum URL length that search engines will crawl and index. They found the limit was 2047 chars, which appears allied to the sitemap protocol spec. However, they also found the Google SERP tool wouldn't cope with URLs longer than 1855 chars.maximum URL length that search engines will crawl and indexSERPCDNs also impose limits on URI length, and will return a 414 Too long request when these limits are reached, for example:414 Too long requestFastlyCloudFrontCloudFlare(credit to timrs2998 for providing that info in the comments)I tested the following against an Apache 2.4 server configured with a very large LimitRequestLine and LimitRequestFieldSize.LimitRequestLineLimitRequestFieldSizeBrowser     Address bar   document.location\\n                          or anchor tag\\n------------------------------------------\\nChrome          32779           >64k\\nAndroid          8192           >64k\\nFirefox          >64k           >64k\\nSafari           >64k           >64k\\nIE11             2047           5120\\nEdge 16          2047          10240\\nSee also this answer from Matas Vaitkevicius below.this answerThis is a popular question, and as the original research is ~14 years old I'll try to keep it up to date: As of Jan 2021, the advice still stands. Even though IE11 may possibly accept longer URLs, the ubiquity of older IE installations plus the search engine limitations mean staying under 2000 chars is the best general policy.\",\n",

I\\'ve split the answer into two parts: Options for genuine arrays, and options for things that are just array-like, such as the arguments object, other iterable objects (ES2015+), DOM collections, and so on.argumentsOkay, let\\'s look at our options:You have five options (two supported basically forever, another added by ECMAScript\\xa05 [\"ES5\"], and two more added in ECMAScript\\xa02015 (\"ES2015\", aka \"ES6\"):for-offorEachforfor-in(You can see those old specs here: ES5, ES2015, but both have been superceded; the current editor\\'s draft is always here.)ES5ES2015hereDetails:for-ofES2015 added iterators and iterables to JavaScript. Arrays are iterable (so are strings, Maps, and Sets, as well as DOM collections and lists, as you\\'ll see later). Iterable objects provide iterators for their values. The new for-of statement loops through the values returned by an iterator:iterators and iterablesMapSetfor-ofconst a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\\nfor (const element of a) { // You can use `let` instead of `const` if you like\\n    console.log(element);\\n}\\n// a\\n// b\\n// cIt doesn\\'t get simpler than that! Under the covers, that gets an iterator from the array and loops through the values the iterator returns. The iterator provided by arrays provides the values of the array elements, in order beginning to end.Notice how element is scoped to each loop iteration; trying to use element after the end of the loop would fail because it doesn\\'t exist outside the loop body.elementelementIn theory, a for-of loop involves several function calls (one to get the iterator, then one to get each value from it). Even when that\\'s true, it\\'s nothing to worry about, function calls are very cheap in modern JavaScript engines (it bothered me for forEach [below] until I looked into it; details). But additionally, JavaScript engines optimize those calls away (in performance-critical code) when dealing with native iterators for things like arrays.for-offorEachdetailsfor-of is entirely async-friendly. If you need the work in a loop body to be done in series (not in parallel), an await in the loop body will wait for the promise to settle before continuing. Here\\'s a silly example:for-ofasyncawaitfunction delay(ms) {\\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\\n    for (const message of messages) {\\n        await delay(400);\\n        console.log(message);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nshowSlowly([\\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\\n]);\\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsNote how the words appear with a delay before each one.It\\'s a matter of coding style, but for-of is the first thing I reach for when looping through anything iterable.for-offorEachIn any even vaguely-modern environment (so, not IE8) where you have access to the Array features added by ES5, you can use forEach (spec | MDN) if you\\'re only dealing with synchronous code (or you don\\'t need to wait for an asynchronous process to finish during the loop):ArrayforEachspecMDNconst a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\\na.forEach((element) => {\\n    console.log(element);\\n});forEach accepts a callback function and, optionally, a value to use as this when calling that callback (not used above). The callback is called for each element in the array, in order, skipping non-existent elements in sparse arrays. Although I only used one parameter above, the callback is called with three arguments: The element for that iteration, the index of that element, and a reference to the array you\\'re iterating over (in case your function doesn\\'t already have it handy).forEachthisLike for-of, forEach has the advantage that you don\\'t have to declare indexing and value variables in the containing scope; in this case, they\\'re supplied as arguments to the iteration function, and so nicely scoped to just that iteration.for-offorEachUnlike for-of, forEach has the disadvantage that it doesn\\'t understand async functions and await. If you use an async function as the callback, forEach does not wait for that function\\'s promise to settle before continuing. Here\\'s the async example from for-of using forEach instead\\xa0— notice how there\\'s an initial delay, but then all the text appears right away instead of waiting:for-offorEachasyncawaitasyncforEachasyncfor-offorEachfunction delay(ms) {\\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\\n    // INCORRECT, doesn\\'t wait before continuing,\\n    // doesn\\'t handle promise rejections\\n    messages.forEach(async message => {\\n        await delay(400);\\n        console.log(message);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nshowSlowly([\\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\\n]);\\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsforEach is the \"loop through them all\" function, but ES5 defined several other useful \"work your way through the array and do things\" functions, including:forEacheveryspecMDNsomespecMDNfilterspecMDNmapspecMDNreducespecMDNreduceRightspecMDNreduceAs with forEach, if you use an async function as your callback, none of those waits for the function\\'s promise to settle.

But as you saw in the examples above, you can use let within the for to scope the variables to just the loop. And when you do that, the index variable is recreated for each loop iteration, meaning closures created in the loop body keep a reference to the index for that specific iteration, which solves the old \"closures in loops\" problem:varletforindexindex// (The `NodeList` from `querySelectorAll` is array-like)\\nconst divs = document.querySelectorAll(\"div\");\\nfor (let index = 0; index < divs.length; ++index) {\\n    divs[index].addEventListener(\\'click\\', e => {\\n        console.log(\"Index is: \" + index);\\n    });\\n}<div>zero</div>\\n<div>one</div>\\n<div>two</div>\\n<div>three</div>\\n<div>four</div>In the above, you get \"Index is: 0\" if you click the first and \"Index is: 4\" if you click the last. This does not work if you use var instead of let (you\\'d always see \"Index is: 5\").varletLike for-of, for loops work well in async functions. Here\\'s the earlier example using a for loop:for-offorasyncforfunction delay(ms) {\\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\\n    for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; ++i) {\\n        const message = messages[i];\\n        await delay(400);\\n        console.log(message);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nshowSlowly([\\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\\n]);\\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsfor-infor-in isn\\'t for looping through arrays, it\\'s for looping through the names of an object\\'s properties. It does often seem to work for looping through arrays as a by-product of the fact that arrays are objects, but it doesn\\'t just loop through the array indexes, it loops through all enumerable properties of the object (including inherited ones). (It also used to be that the order wasn\\'t specified; it is now [details in this other answer], but even though the order is specified now, the rules are complex, there are exceptions, and relying on the order is not best practice.)for-inthis other answerThe only real use cases for for-in on an array are:for-insparse arrayLooking only at that first example: You can use for-in to visit those sparse array elements if you use appropriate safeguards:for-in// `a` is a sparse array\\nconst a = [];\\na[0] = \"a\";\\na[10] = \"b\";\\na[10000] = \"c\";\\nfor (const name in a) {\\n    if (Object.hasOwn(a, name) &&       // These checks are\\n        /^0$|^[1-9]\\\\d*$/.test(name) &&  // explained\\n        name <= 4294967294              // below\\n       ) {\\n        const element = a[name];\\n        console.log(a[name]);\\n    }\\n}Note the three checks:That the object has its own property by that name (not one it inherits from its prototype; this check is also often written as a.hasOwnProperty(name) but ES2022 adds Object.hasOwn which can be more reliable), anda.hasOwnProperty(name)Object.hasOwnObject.hasOwnThat the name is all decimal digits (e.g., normal string form, not scientific notation), andThat the name\\'s value when coerced to a number is <= 2^32 - 2 (which is 4,294,967,294). Where does that number come from? It\\'s part of the definition of an array index in the specification. Other numbers (non-integers, negative numbers, numbers greater than 2^32 - 2) are not array indexes. The reason it\\'s 2^32 - 2 is that that makes the greatest index value one lower than 2^32 - 1, which is the maximum value an array\\'s length can have. (E.g., an array\\'s length fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer.)in the specificationlength...although with that said, most code only does the hasOwnProperty check.hasOwnPropertyYou wouldn\\'t do that in inline code, of course. You\\'d write a utility function.

Sometimes, you might want to use an iterator explicitly. It looks like this:for-ofconst a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\\nconst it = a.values(); // Or `const it = a[Symbol.iterator]();` if you like\\nlet entry;\\nwhile (!(entry = it.next()).done) {\\n    const element = entry.value;\\n    console.log(element);\\n}An iterator is an object matching the Iterator definition in the specification. Its next method returns a new result object each time you call it. The result object has a property, done, telling us whether it\\'s done, and a property value with the value for that iteration. (done is optional if it would be false, value is optional if it would be undefined.)nextdonevaluedonefalsevalueundefinedWhat you get for value varies depending on the iterator. On arrays, the default iterator provides the value of each array element (\"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" in the example earlier). Arrays also have three other methods that return iterators:value\"a\"\"b\"\"c\"values()[Symbol.iterator]keys()\"0\"\"1\"\"2\"entries()[key, value]Since iterator objects don\\'t advance until you call next, they work well in async function loops. Here\\'s the earlier for-of example using the iterator explicitly:nextasyncfor-offunction delay(ms) {\\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\\n    });\\n}\\n\\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\\n    const it = messages.values()\\n    while (!(entry = it.next()).done) {\\n        await delay(400);\\n        const element = entry.value;\\n        console.log(element);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nshowSlowly([\\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\\n]);\\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsAside from true arrays, there are also array-like objects that have a length property and properties with all-digits names: NodeList instances, HTMLCollection instances, the arguments object, etc. How do we loop through their contents?lengthNodeList instancesNodeListHTMLCollection instancesHTMLCollectionargumentsAt least some, and possibly most or even all, of the array approaches above apply equally well to array-like objects:Use for-of (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)for-offor-of uses the iterator provided by the object (if any). That includes host-provided objects (like DOM collections and lists). For instance, HTMLCollection instances from getElementsByXYZ methods and NodeLists instances from querySelectorAll both support iteration. (This is defined quite subtly by the HTML and DOM specifications. Basically, any object with length and indexed access is automatically iterable. It doesn\\'t have to be marked iterable; that is used only for collections that, in addition to being iterable, support forEach, values, keys, and entries methods. NodeList does; HTMLCollection doesn\\'t, but both are iterable.)for-ofiteratorHTMLCollectiongetElementsByXYZNodeListquerySelectorAlllengthiterableforEachvalueskeysentriesNodeListHTMLCollectionHere\\'s an example of looping through div elements:divconst divs = document.querySelectorAll(\"div\");\\nfor (const div of divs) {\\n    div.textContent = Math.random();\\n}<div>zero</div>\\n<div>one</div>\\n<div>two</div>\\n<div>three</div>\\n<div>four</div>Use forEach and related (ES5+)forEachThe various functions on Array.prototype are \"intentionally generic\" and can be used on array-like objects via Function#call (spec | MDN) or Function#apply (spec | MDN).

Doing that is surprisingly easy:Use Array.fromArray.fromArray.from (spec) | (MDN) (ES2015+, but easily polyfilled) creates an array from an array-like object, optionally passing the entries through a mapping function first. So:Array.from(spec)(MDN)const divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"div\"));\\n...takes the NodeList from querySelectorAll and makes an array from it.NodeListquerySelectorAllThe mapping function is handy if you were going to map the contents in some way. For instance, if you wanted to get an array of the tag names of the elements with a given class:// Typical use (with an arrow function):\\nconst divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\".some-class\"), element => element.tagName);\\n\\n// Traditional function (since `Array.from` can be polyfilled):\\nvar divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\".some-class\"), function(element) {\\n    return element.tagName;\\n});\\nUse spread syntax (...)...It\\'s also possible to use ES2015\\'s spread syntax. Like for-of, this uses the iterator provided by the object (see #1 in the previous section):spread syntaxfor-ofiteratorconst trueArray = [...iterableObject];\\nSo for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, with spread syntax this becomes quite succinct:NodeListconst divs = [...document.querySelectorAll(\"div\")];\\nUse the slice method of arrayssliceWe can use the slice method of arrays, which like the other methods mentioned above is \"intentionally generic\" and so can be used with array-like objects, like this:slicesliceconst trueArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLikeObject);\\nSo for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, we could do this:NodeListconst divs = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(\"div\"));\\n(If you still have to handle IE8 [ouch], will fail; IE8 didn\\'t let you use host-provided objects as this like that.)thisIf you use Array.prototype functions with host-provided array-like objects (for example, DOM collections and such provided by the browser rather than the JavaScript engine), obsolete browsers like IE8 didn\\'t necessarily handle that way, so if you have to support them, be sure to test in your target environments.

The simplest and probably most used isvar temp = [1, 2, 3];\\nangular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\\n    //item will be each element in the array\\n    //do something\\n});\\nAnother way that is useful for copying items from one array to another isvar temp = [1, 2, 3];\\nvar temp2 = [];\\nangular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\\n    this.push(item); //\"this\" refers to the array passed into the optional third parameter so, in this case, temp2.\\n}, temp2);\\nThough, you don\\'t have to do that, you can simply do the following and it\\'s equivalent to the previous example:angular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\\n    temp2.push(item);\\n});\\nNow there are pros and cons of using the angular.forEach function as opposed to the built in vanilla-flavored for loop.angular.forEachforProsangular.forEachConsider the following 2 nested loops, which do exactly the same thing. Let\\'s say that we have 2 arrays of objects and each object contains an array of results, each of which has a Value property that\\'s a string (or whatever).

However, some are more convenient than others. Below you can find some commonly used methods (the most convenient IMO) to accomplish array iteration in JavaScript.Mapmap() is a function located on Array.prototype which can transform every element of an array and then returns a new array. map() takes as an argument a callback function and works in the following manner:map()Array.prototypemap()let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\r\\n\\r\\nlet newArr = arr.map((element, index, array) => {\\r\\n  return element * 2;\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\nconsole.log(arr);\\r\\nconsole.log(newArr);The callback which we have passed into map() as an argument gets executed for every element. Then an array gets returned which has the same length as the original array. In this new array element is transformed by the callback function passed in as an argument to map().map()map()The distinct difference between map and another loop mechanism like forEach and a for..of loop is that map returns a new array and leaves the old array intact (except if you explicitly manipulate it with thinks like splice).mapforEachfor..ofmapspliceAlso, note that the map function's callback provides the index number of the current iteration as a second argument. Furthermore, does the third argument provide the array on which map was called? Sometimes these properties can be very useful.mapmapforEachforEach is a function which is located on Array.prototype which takes a callback function as an argument. It then executes this callback function for every element in the array. In contrast to the map() function, the forEach function returns nothing (undefined). For example:forEachArray.prototypemap()undefinedlet arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\r\\n\\r\\narr.forEach((element, index, array) => {\\r\\n\\r\\n  console.log(element * 2);\\r\\n\\r\\n  if (index === 4) {\\r\\n    console.log(array)\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  // index, and oldArray are provided as 2nd and 3th argument by the callback\\r\\n\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\nconsole.log(arr);Just like the map function, the forEach callback provides the index number of the current iteration as a second argument. Also, does the third argument provide the array on which forEach was called?mapforEachforEachfor..ofThe for..of loop loops through every element of an array (or any other iterable object).

        "  'answers': ['To understand what yield does, you must understand what generators are. And before you can understand generators, you must understand iterables.yieldWhen you create a list, you can read its items one by one. Reading its items one by one is called iteration:>>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]\\n>>> for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n1\\n2\\n3\\nmylist is an iterable. When you use a list comprehension, you create a list, and so an iterable:mylist>>> mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\\n>>> for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\nEverything you can use \"for... in...\" on is an iterable; lists, strings, files...for... in...listsstringsThese iterables are handy because you can read them as much as you wish, but you store all the values in memory and this is not always what you want when you have a lot of values.Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly:>>> mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\nIt is just the same except you used () instead of []. BUT, you cannot perform for i in mygenerator a second time since generators can only be used once: they calculate 0, then forget about it and calculate 1, and end calculating 4, one by one.()[]for i in mygeneratoryield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.yieldreturn>>> def create_generator():\\n...    mylist = range(3)\\n...    for i in mylist:\\n...        yield i*i\\n...\\n>>> mygenerator = create_generator() # create a generator\\n>>> print(mygenerator) # mygenerator is an object!\\n<generator object create_generator at 0xb7555c34>\\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\\n...     print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\nHere it\\'s a useless example, but it\\'s handy when you know your function will return a huge set of values that you will only need to read once.To master yield, you must understand that when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky.yieldThen, your code will continue from where it left off each time for uses the generator.forNow the hard part:The first time the for calls the generator object created from your function, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits yield, then it\\'ll return the first value of the loop. Then, each subsequent call will run another iteration of the loop you have written in the function and return the next value. This will continue until the generator is considered empty, which happens when the function runs without hitting yield. That can be because the loop has come to an end, or because you no longer satisfy an \"if/else\".foryieldyield\"if/else\"Generator:# Here you create the method of the node object that will return the generator\\ndef _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):\\n\\n    # Here is the code that will be called each time you use the generator object:\\n\\n    # If there is still a child of the node object on its left\\n    # AND if the distance is ok, return the next child\\n    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist < self._median:\\n        yield self._leftchild\\n\\n    # If there is still a child of the node object on its right\\n    # AND if the distance is ok, return the next child\\n    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist >= self._median:\\n        yield self._rightchild\\n\\n    # If the function arrives here, the generator will be considered empty\\n    # there are no more than two values: the left and the right children\\nCaller:# Create an empty list and a list with the current object reference\\nresult, candidates = list(), [self]\\n\\n# Loop on candidates (they contain only one element at the beginning)\\nwhile candidates:\\n\\n    # Get the last candidate and remove it from the list\\n    node = candidates.pop()\\n\\n    # Get the distance between obj and the candidate\\n    distance = node._get_dist(obj)\\n\\n    # If the distance is ok, then you can fill in the result\\n    if distance <= max_dist and distance >= min_dist:\\n        result.extend(node._values)\\n\\n    # Add the children of the candidate to the candidate\\'s list\\n    # so the loop will keep running until it has looked\\n    # at all the children of the children of the children, etc. of the candidate\\n    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))\\n\\nreturn result\\nThis code contains several smart parts:The loop iterates on a list, but the list expands while the loop is being iterated. It\\'s a concise way to go through all these nested data even if it\\'s a bit dangerous since you can end up with an infinite loop. In this case, candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist)) exhausts all the values of the generator, but while keeps creating new generator objects which will produce different values from the previous ones since it\\'s not applied on the same node.candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))whileThe extend() method is a list object method that expects an iterable and adds its values to the list.extend()Usually, we pass a list to it:>>> a = [1, 2]\\n>>> b = [3, 4]\\n>>> a.extend(b)\\n>>> print(a)\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\nBut in your code, it gets a generator, which is good because:And it works because Python does not care if the argument of a method is a list or not. Python expects iterables so it will work with strings, lists, tuples, and generators! This is called duck typing and is one of the reasons why Python is so cool. But this is another story, for another question...You can stop here, or read a little bit to see an advanced use of a generator:>>> class Bank(): # Let\\'s create a bank, building ATMs\\n...    crisis = False\\n...    def create_atm(self):\\n...        while not self.crisis:\\n...            yield \"$100\"\\n>>> hsbc = Bank() # When everything\\'s ok the ATM gives you as much as you want\\n>>> corner_street_atm = hsbc.create_atm()\\n>>> print(corner_street_atm.next())\\n$100\\n>>> print(corner_street_atm.next())\\n$100\\n>>> print([corner_street_atm.next() for cash in range(5)])\\n[\\'$100\\', \\'$100\\', \\'$100\\', \\'$100\\', \\'$100\\']\\n>>> hsbc.crisis = True # Crisis is coming, no more money!\\n>>> print(corner_street_atm.next())\\n<type \\'exceptions.StopIteration\\'>\\n>>> wall_street_atm = hsbc.create_atm() # It\\'s even true for new ATMs\\n>>> print(wall_street_atm.next())\\n<type \\'exceptions.StopIteration\\'>\\n>>> hsbc.crisis = False # The trouble is, even post-crisis the ATM remains empty\\n>>> print(corner_street_atm.next())\\n<type \\'exceptions.StopIteration\\'>\\n>>> brand_new_atm = hsbc.create_atm() # Build a new one to get back in business\\n>>> for cash in brand_new_atm:\\n...    print cash\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n$100\\n...\\nNote: For Python 3, useprint(corner_street_atm.__next__()) or print(next(corner_street_atm))print(corner_street_atm.__next__())print(next(corner_street_atm))It can be useful for various things like controlling access to a resource.The itertools module contains special functions to manipulate iterables.

        "   \"yieldWhen you see a function with yield statements, apply this easy trick to understand what will happen:yieldresult = []yield exprresult.append(expr)return resultyieldThis trick may give you an idea of the logic behind the function, but what actually happens with yield is significantly different than what happens in the list-based approach. In many cases, the yield approach will be a lot more memory efficient and faster too. In other cases, this trick will get you stuck in an infinite loop, even though the original function works just fine. Read on to learn more...yieldFirst, the iterator protocol - when you writefor x in mylist:\\n    ...loop body...\\nPython performs the following two steps:Gets an iterator for mylist:mylistCall iter(mylist) -> this returns an object with a next() method (or __next__() in Python 3).iter(mylist)next()__next__()[This is the step most people forget to tell you about]Uses the iterator to loop over items:Keep calling the next() method on the iterator returned from step 1. The return value from next() is assigned to x and the loop body is executed. If an exception StopIteration is raised from within next(), it means there are no more values in the iterator and the loop is exited.next()next()xStopIterationnext()The truth is Python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loop over the contents of an object - so it could be a for loop, but it could also be code like otherlist.extend(mylist) (where otherlist is a Python list).otherlist.extend(mylist)otherlistHere mylist is an iterable because it implements the iterator protocol. In a user-defined class, you can implement the __iter__() method to make instances of your class iterable. This method should return an iterator. An iterator is an object with a next() method. It is possible to implement both __iter__() and next() on the same class, and have __iter__() return self. This will work for simple cases, but not when you want two iterators looping over the same object at the same time.mylist__iter__()next()__iter__()next()__iter__()selfSo that's the iterator protocol, many objects implement this protocol:__iter__()Note that a for loop doesn't know what kind of object it's dealing with - it just follows the iterator protocol, and is happy to get item after item as it calls next(). Built-in lists return their items one by one, dictionaries return the keys one by one, files return the lines one by one, etc. And generators return... well that's where yield comes in:fornext()yielddef f123():\\n    yield 1\\n    yield 2\\n    yield 3\\n\\nfor item in f123():\\n    print item\\nInstead of yield statements, if you had three return statements in f123() only the first would get executed, and the function would exit. But f123() is no ordinary function. When f123() is called, it does not return any of the values in the yield statements! It returns a generator object. Also, the function does not really exit - it goes into a suspended state. When the for loop tries to loop over the generator object, the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from, executes the next line of code, in this case, a yield statement, and returns that as the next item. This happens until the function exits, at which point the generator raises StopIteration, and the loop exits.yieldreturnf123()f123()f123()foryieldyieldStopIterationSo the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol, by exposing __iter__() and next() methods to keep the for loop happy. At the other end, however, it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it, and puts it back in suspended mode.__iter__()next()forUsually, you can write code that doesn't use generators but implements the same logic. One option is to use the temporary list 'trick' I mentioned before. That will not work in all cases, for e.g. if you have infinite loops, or it may make inefficient use of memory when you have a really long list. The other approach is to implement a new iterable class SomethingIter that keeps the state in instance members and performs the next logical step in its next() (or __next__() in Python 3) method. Depending on the logic, the code inside the next() method may end up looking very complex and prone to bugs. Here generators provide a clean and easy solution.next()__next__()next()\",\n",

        "   'The yield keyword is reduced to two simple facts:yieldyieldreturnlistsetrangeIn a nutshell: Most commonly, a generator is a lazy, incrementally-pending list, and yield statements allow you to use function notation to program the list values the generator should incrementally spit out.

You might have encountered generators with generator expressions; generator functions are more powerful because you can pass arguments back into the paused generator function, using them to implement coroutines. More on that later.yieldnext()StopIterationgenerator expressionsLet\\'s define a function makeRange that\\'s just like Python\\'s range. Calling makeRange(n) RETURNS A GENERATOR:makeRangerangemakeRange(n)def makeRange(n):\\n    # return 0,1,2,...,n-1\\n    i = 0\\n    while i < n:\\n        yield i\\n        i += 1\\n\\n>>> makeRange(5)\\n<generator object makeRange at 0x19e4aa0>\\nTo force the generator to immediately return its pending values, you can pass it into list() (just like you could any iterable):list()>>> list(makeRange(5))\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\nThe above example can be thought of as merely creating a list which you append to and return:# return a list                  #  # return a generator\\ndef makeRange(n):                #  def makeRange(n):\\n    \"\"\"return [0,1,2,...,n-1]\"\"\" #      \"\"\"return 0,1,2,...,n-1\"\"\"\\n    TO_RETURN = []               # \\n    i = 0                        #      i = 0\\n    while i < n:                 #      while i < n:\\n        TO_RETURN += [i]         #          yield i\\n        i += 1                   #          i += 1\\n    return TO_RETURN             # \\n\\n>>> makeRange(5)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\nThere is one major difference, though; see the last section.An iterable is the last part of a list comprehension, and all generators are iterable, so they\\'re often used like so:#                  < ITERABLE >\\n>>> [x+10 for x in makeRange(5)]\\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\nTo get a better feel for generators, you can play around with the itertools module (be sure to use chain.from_iterable rather than chain when warranted). For example, you might even use generators to implement infinitely-long lazy lists like itertools.count(). You could implement your own def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable), or alternatively do so with the yield keyword in a while-loop.itertoolschain.from_iterablechainitertools.count()def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable)yieldPlease note: generators can actually be used for many more things, such as implementing coroutines or non-deterministic programming or other elegant things. However, the \"lazy lists\" viewpoint I present here is the most common use you will find.implementing coroutinesThis is how the \"Python iteration protocol\" works. That is, what is going on when you do list(makeRange(5)). This is what I describe earlier as a \"lazy, incremental list\".list(makeRange(5))>>> x=iter(range(5))\\n>>> next(x)  # calls x.__next__(); x.next() is deprecated\\n0\\n>>> next(x)\\n1\\n>>> next(x)\\n2\\n>>> next(x)\\n3\\n>>> next(x)\\n4\\n>>> next(x)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nStopIteration\\nThe built-in function next() just calls the objects .__next__() function, which is a part of the \"iteration protocol\" and is found on all iterators. You can manually use the next() function (and other parts of the iteration protocol) to implement fancy things, usually at the expense of readability, so try to avoid doing that...next().__next__()next()Coroutine example:Coroutinedef interactiveProcedure():\\n    userResponse = yield makeQuestionWebpage()\\n    print(\\'user response:\\', userResponse)\\n    yield \\'success\\'\\n\\ncoroutine = interactiveProcedure()\\nwebFormData = next(coroutine)  # same as .send(None)\\nuserResponse = serveWebForm(webFormData)\\n\\n# ...at some point later on web form submit...\\n\\nsuccessStatus = coroutine.send(userResponse)\\nA coroutine (generators which generally accept input via the yield keyword e.g. nextInput = yield nextOutput, as a form of two-way communication) is basically a computation which is allowed to pause itself and request input (e.g. to what it should do next). When the coroutine pauses itself (when the running coroutine eventually hits a yield keyword), the computation is paused and control is inverted (yielded) back to the \\'calling\\' function (the frame which requested the next value of the computation). The paused generator/coroutine remains paused until another invoking function (possibly a different function/context) requests the next value to unpause it (usually passing input data to direct the paused logic interior to the coroutine\\'s code).yieldnextInput = yield nextOutputyieldnextYou can think of python coroutines as lazy incrementally-pending lists, where the next element doesn\\'t just depend on the previous computation, but also on input you may opt to inject during the generation process.Normally, most people would not care about the following distinctions and probably want to stop reading here.In Python-speak, an iterable is any object which \"understands the concept of a for-loop\" like a list [1,2,3], and an iterator is a specific instance of the requested for-loop like [1,2,3].__iter__(). A generator is exactly the same as any iterator, except for the way it was written (with function syntax).[1,2,3][1,2,3].__iter__()When you request an iterator from a list, it creates a new iterator. However, when you request an iterator from an iterator (which you would rarely do), it just gives you a copy of itself.Thus, in the unlikely event that you are failing to do something like this...> x = myRange(5)\\n> list(x)\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n> list(x)\\n[]\\n... then remember that a generator is an iterator; that is, it is one-time-use. If you want to reuse it, you should call myRange(...) again. If you need to use the result twice, convert the result to a list and store it in a variable x = list(myRange(5)). Those who absolutely need to clone a generator (for example, who are doing terrifyingly hackish metaprogramming) can use itertools.tee (still works in Python 3) if absolutely necessary, since the copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal has been deferred.myRange(...)x = list(myRange(5))itertools.teeitertools.teestill works in Python 3copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal',\n",

        "   \"There is one type of answer that I don't feel has been given yet, among the many great answers that describe how to use generators. Here is the programming language theory answer:The yield statement in Python returns a generator. A generator in Python is a function that returns continuations (and specifically a type of coroutine, but continuations represent the more general mechanism to understand what is going on).yieldContinuations in programming languages theory are a much more fundamental kind of computation, but they are not often used, because they are extremely hard to reason about and also very difficult to implement. But the idea of what a continuation is, is straightforward: it is the state of a computation that has not yet finished. In this state, the current values of variables, the operations that have yet to be performed, and so on, are saved. Then at some point later in the program the continuation can be invoked, such that the program's variables are reset to that state and the operations that were saved are carried out.Continuations, in this more general form, can be implemented in two ways. In the call/cc way, the program's stack is literally saved and then when the continuation is invoked, the stack is restored.call/ccIn continuation passing style (CPS), continuations are just normal functions (only in languages where functions are first class) which the programmer explicitly manages and passes around to subroutines. In this style, program state is represented by closures (and the variables that happen to be encoded in them) rather than variables that reside somewhere on the stack. Functions that manage control flow accept continuation as arguments (in some variations of CPS, functions may accept multiple continuations) and manipulate control flow by invoking them by simply calling them and returning afterwards. A very simple example of continuation passing style is as follows:def save_file(filename):\\n  def write_file_continuation():\\n    write_stuff_to_file(filename)\\n\\n  check_if_file_exists_and_user_wants_to_overwrite(write_file_continuation)\\nIn this (very simplistic) example, the programmer saves the operation of actually writing the file into a continuation (which can potentially be a very complex operation with many details to write out), and then passes that continuation (i.e, as a first-class closure) to another operator which does some more processing, and then calls it if necessary. (I use this design pattern a lot in actual GUI programming, either because it saves me lines of code or, more importantly, to manage control flow after GUI events trigger.)The rest of this post will, without loss of generality, conceptualize continuations as CPS, because it is a hell of a lot easier to understand and read.Now let's talk about generators in Python. Generators are a specific subtype of continuation. Whereas continuations are able in general to save the state of a computation (i.e., the program's call stack), generators are only able to save the state of iteration over an iterator. Although, this definition is slightly misleading for certain use cases of generators. For instance:def f():\\n  while True:\\n    yield 4\\nThis is clearly a reasonable iterable whose behavior is well defined -- each time the generator iterates over it, it returns 4 (and does so forever). But it isn't probably the prototypical type of iterable that comes to mind when thinking of iterators (i.e., for x in collection: do_something(x)). This example illustrates the power of generators: if anything is an iterator, a generator can save the state of its iteration.for x in collection: do_something(x)To reiterate: Continuations can save the state of a program's stack and generators can save the state of iteration. This means that continuations are more a lot powerful than generators, but also that generators are a lot, lot easier. They are easier for the language designer to implement, and they are easier for the programmer to use (if you have some time to burn, try to read and understand this page about continuations and call/cc).this page about continuations and call/ccBut you could easily implement (and conceptualize) generators as a simple, specific case of continuation passing style:Whenever yield is called, it tells the function to return a continuation.  When the function is called again, it starts from wherever it left off. So, in pseudo-pseudocode (i.e., not pseudocode, but not code) the generator's next method is basically as follows:yieldnextclass Generator():\\n  def __init__(self,iterable,generatorfun):\\n    self.next_continuation = lambda:generatorfun(iterable)\\n\\n  def next(self):\\n    value, next_continuation = self.next_continuation()\\n    self.next_continuation = next_continuation\\n    return value\\nwhere the yield keyword is actually syntactic sugar for the real generator function, basically something like:yielddef generatorfun(iterable):\\n  if len(iterable) == 0:\\n    raise StopIteration\\n  else:\\n    return (iterable[0], lambda:generatorfun(iterable[1:]))\\nRemember that this is just pseudocode and the actual implementation of generators in Python is more complex. But as an exercise to understand what is going on, try to use continuation passing style to implement generator objects without use of the yield keyword.yield\",\n",

So, I do the following:defyieldnext(generator).next.__next__next()len().__len__StopIterationreturnThis is what a generator does (a function that contains a yield); it starts executing on the first next(), pauses whenever it does a yield, and when asked for the next() value it continues from the point it was last.

        "   \"Here is a mental image of what yield does.yieldI like to think of a thread as having a stack (even when it's not implemented that way).When a normal function is called, it puts its local variables on the stack, does some computation, then clears the stack and returns. The values of its local variables are never seen again.With a yield function, when its code begins to run (i.e. after the function is called, returning a generator object, whose next() method is then invoked), it similarly puts its local variables onto the stack and computes for a while. But then, when it hits the yield statement, before clearing its part of the stack and returning, it takes a snapshot of its local variables and stores them in the generator object. It also writes down the place where it's currently up to in its code (i.e. the particular yield statement).yieldnext()yieldyieldSo it's a kind of a frozen function that the generator is hanging onto.When next() is called subsequently, it retrieves the function's belongings onto the stack and re-animates it. The function continues to compute from where it left off, oblivious to the fact that it had just spent an eternity in cold storage.next()Compare the following examples:def normalFunction():\\n    return\\n    if False:\\n        pass\\n\\ndef yielderFunction():\\n    return\\n    if False:\\n        yield 12\\nWhen we call the second function, it behaves very differently to the first.

        "   'Imagine that you have created a remarkable machine that is capable of generating thousands and thousands of lightbulbs per day. The machine generates these lightbulbs in boxes with a unique serial number. You don\\'t have enough space to store all of these lightbulbs at the same time, so you would like to adjust it to generate lightbulbs on-demand.Python generators don\\'t differ much from this concept. Imagine that you have a function called barcode_generator that generates unique serial numbers for the boxes. Obviously, you can have a huge number of such barcodes returned by the function, subject to the hardware (RAM) limitations. A wiser, and space efficient, option is to generate those serial numbers on-demand.barcode_generatorMachine\\'s code:def barcode_generator():\\n    serial_number = 10000  # Initial barcode\\n    while True:\\n        yield serial_number\\n        serial_number += 1\\n\\n\\nbarcode = barcode_generator()\\nwhile True:\\n    number_of_lightbulbs_to_generate = int(input(\"How many lightbulbs to generate? \"))\\n    barcodes = [next(barcode) for _ in range(number_of_lightbulbs_to_generate)]\\n    print(barcodes)\\n\\n    # function_to_create_the_next_batch_of_lightbulbs(barcodes)\\n\\n    produce_more = input(\"Produce more?

This function returns a generator! As you can see, we are not calling the function each time we need a new serial number, but instead we are using next() given the generator to obtain the next serial number.next()To be more precise, this generator is a lazy iterator! An iterator is an object that helps us traverse a sequence of objects. It\\'s called lazy because it does not load all the items of the sequence in memory until they are needed. The use of next in the previous example is the explicit way to obtain the next item from the iterator. The implicit way is using for loops:nextfor barcode in barcode_generator():\\n    print(barcode)\\nThis will print barcodes infinitely, yet you will not run out of memory.In other words, a generator looks like a function but behaves like an iterator.Finally, real-world applications? They are usually useful when you work with big sequences. Imagine reading a huge file from disk with billions of records. Reading the entire file in memory, before you can work with its content, will probably be infeasible (i.e., you will run out of memory).',\n",

That function will return an object of generator type. The yield keyword is a flag to notify the python compiler to treat such function specially. Normal functions will terminate once some value is returned from it. But with the help of the compiler, the generator function can be thought of as resumable. That is, the execution context will be restored and the execution will continue from last run.

But this naive approach is problematic. If the data volume is huge, it's expensive to store them as a whole beforehand.

        "   \"In summary, the yield statement transforms your function into a factory that produces a special object called a generator which wraps around the body of your original function. When the generator is iterated, it executes your function  until it reaches the next yield then suspends execution and evaluates to the value passed to yield. It repeats this process on each iteration until the path of execution exits the function. For instance,yieldgeneratorgeneratoryieldyielddef simple_generator():\\n    yield 'one'\\n    yield 'two'\\n    yield 'three'\\n\\nfor i in simple_generator():\\n    print i\\nsimply outputsone\\ntwo\\nthree\\nThe power comes from using the generator with a loop that calculates a sequence, the generator executes the loop stopping each time to 'yield' the next result of the calculation, in this way it calculates a list on the fly, the benefit being the memory saved for especially large calculationsSay you wanted to create a your own range function that produces an iterable range of numbers, you could do it like so,rangedef myRangeNaive(i):\\n    n = 0\\n    range = []\\n    while n < i:\\n        range.append(n)\\n        n = n + 1\\n    return range\\nand use it like this;for i in myRangeNaive(10):\\n    print i\\nBut this is inefficient becauseLuckily Guido and his team were generous enough to develop generators so we could just do this;def myRangeSmart(i):\\n    n = 0\\n    while n < i:\\n       yield n\\n       n = n + 1\\n    return\\n\\nfor i in myRangeSmart(10):\\n    print i\\nNow upon each iteration a function on the generator called next() executes the function until it either reaches a 'yield' statement in which it stops and  'yields' the value or reaches the end of the function. In this case on the first call, next() executes up to the yield statement and yield 'n', on the next call it will execute the  increment statement, jump back to the 'while', evaluate it, and if true, it will stop and yield 'n' again, it will continue that way until the while condition returns false and the generator jumps to the end of the function.next()next()\",\n",
